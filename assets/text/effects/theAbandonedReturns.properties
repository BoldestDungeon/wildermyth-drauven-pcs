We don't want to kill any more of them than we have to./I just can't help but wonder if that Drauven kid is still out here, somewhere.

So they can sneak around and stab you in the back?/Don't you start going soft on us, or you'll get us [i]all[] killed./Well, hopefully they're somewhere far away and not with the Drauven lurking here.../They'd probably appreciate us slow-roasting over their fires a lot [i]more[]./You're still thinking about that scaly child-monster you rescued a few years back, aren't you?/That was a [i]monster[], <healer.name>!
