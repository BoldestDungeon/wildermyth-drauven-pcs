~01~~panel_001~1_narration=Three days scouring for books about a particular Drauven hero have turned up one brief passage.
~01~~panel_001~4_hero=Hey, <hero.pcfn.hero2:<hero2.mf:boy/girl/kid>, you're not sneaking by me./<hero2.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>, your <hero.mf:son's/daughter's/child's> brilliant./<hero2>./<hero.rfln.hero2:<hero2.mf:Lord/Lady/Old> Biscuit-hand./<hero2>./love, you going somewhere?/<hero2>.>> Come listen to this.
~01~~panel_002~2_hero=[i]"While images of a house-sized Drauv swinging shield and staff are very clearly phantasm, summoned from firelight and whiskeywater, the reputable accounts of warriors, to this day, claim that Vracsel—"[]
~01~~panel_002~3_hero2=[small]Rascal?![face:skeptical]<hero2.goofball.60:[face:joy]/>
~01~~panel_003~2_hero=No, [i]Vvv[]-rack-sull.
~01~~panel_003~3_hero2=<hero2.goofball.60:[face:happy]Rascal./Vvvvracsel.>
~01~~panel_004~2_hero=Let's see, [i]"...[small]accounts of[] warriors, to this day, claim that Vracsel [i]did[] exist. Did lead Drauven forces from the front, galloping on <subPlot.mf:his/her/their> long legs, and lashing even with <subPlot.mf:his/her/their> tail, bound with iron. <subPlot.mf:He/She/They> survived every encounter, the wounds <subPlot.mf:he/she/they> took mending quick. <subPlot.mf:He/She/They> drowned in a flood, one notably rainy <season>."
~01~~panel_004~4_hero2=<subPlot.mf:He/She/They> drowned in a [i]flood some <season>?![]
~01~~panel_005~2_hero="The rainiest <season> anyone remembered," according to this.
~01~~panel_005~3_hero2=Vracsel.
~01~~panel_006~6_hero2=So Drauven are [i]using[] this name—from one of their heroes, you're saying, \nVracsel—using it as a unifying... a whatever-it-is. A rallying cry.
~01~~panel_006~7_hero=Well, it [i]could[] be more.
~01~~panel_007~7_hero=<hero2.bookish/coward/greedy/leader/poet/60:Yeah. If they were found. Hero-weapons [i]are[] often battle-deciders./Vracsel's hero-weapons. They were powerful objects, you know? Not just as symbols, but as things to swing. So if they were found.../Yeah. If the hero-weapons grant a kind of power of their own... not just symbolic, but practical. Might be what's making them fierce./Yeah. If the hero-weapons grant a kind of power of their own... not just symbolic, but practical. Might be what's making them fierce./Yeah. If the hero-weapons grant a kind of power of their own... not just symbolic, but practical. Might be what's making them fierce./Vracsel's hero-weapons were lost, but they may have been [i]found.[] They were powerful objects, you know? Not just as symbols, but as things to swing.>
~01~~panel_008~6_hero2=<hero2.bookish/coward/greedy/leader/poet/60:The articles of the hero actually [i]grant[] them power, you're saying./[face:interested]Oh. [i]Could[] it be?/[face:skeptical]If they found the weapons themselves, you must mean?/Maybe if they've actually found \nthe weapons themselves./[face:neutral]Yes. If they've found the weapons themselves./[face:skeptical]Alright. You're welcome to tell me what you mean at any point.>
~01~~panel_009~8_hero2=So the place we know of, it's obviously not their true headquarters. But it's at least a step in that direction.
~01~~panel_009~9_hero=Reasonable to assume getting there, and securing it, we should have a clearer idea of where the heart of their operations is beating.
~01~~panel_010~1_hero2=<hero2.loner/snark/60:[face:neutral]/[face:skeptical]/[face:talking]>
~01~~panel_010~2_narration=Drauven aggression has grown since <season-2>. The name Vracsel is chanted to the beat of their stomps and smash of their blades.
~01~~panel_010~3_narration=The company sets out to mend shattered homes, and discover how this old Drauven hero is striking at them from the grave.
