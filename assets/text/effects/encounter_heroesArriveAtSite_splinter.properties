~01~prompt~panel_003~2_loner=Hey. I got a splinter.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hothead=You say you got a splinter?
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_loner=<loner.personality:Rather strangely, yes. From a living tree?/Is that what it's called? Not sliver, right?/If a splinter's what I think it is, then yes./Isn't that unlucky?/Yeah, don't worry about it. But/[face:angry]I said/That's right./[face:neutral]Hm? Oh. Said/Or it got me. But yes./[face:happy]Someone's hiding their feelings for me. Isn't that what they say? So/Think so. Think> I got a splinter.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_statCharisma=You got a splinter?
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_hothead=<hothead.coward/goofball/healer/snark/60:[face:interested][small]That's why I stay off \nthose porch chairs.[]/[face:neutral][small]Well [i]I[] got a drinking problem./Now, I'm not saying splinters don't hurt, but.../Yeah, please.

~01~prompt~panel_008~1_loner=<loner.greedy/hothead/leader/loner/80:[face:skeptical]Remind me to put the dice down for a while. /[face:dubious]And of course I did. /[face:skeptical]Oof. /[face:neutral]Mm. /[face:interested]Whew, >I got a [i]mean[] splinter. See? Sliding past an elm.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_statCharisma=<statCharisma.bookish/hothead/loner/snark/60:<npc.fullname> had a chapter on \nsplinters. Let me try <npc.mf:his/her/their> method...[face:interested]/There's a trick to splinters, and \nI happen to be the best at it./[face:skeptical]Taken out plenty of my [i]own[] before. \nHow deep?/[face:talking]That's my specialty. Splinter-picker, \nmosquito-chaser. Show me./I've gotten a bunch of splinters \n[i]out[], in my day. I'll have a look.>

~01~prompt~panel_010~3_hothead=<hothead.coward/goofball/healer/snark/60:[face:interested]What's it look like? No, actually, don't tell me. \nIs it gross? I don't want to look.../[face:neutral]Lot of bushes in the vicinity.\nThink I'll hide in one. Or...?/[face:talking]I guess I'm just concerned because \nwe're close to the <site.station>, now.../[face:neutral]Yep. This is exactly who we are./[face:grim]The <site.station> was just a bit further, so... \nShould this be our priority?>
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_statCharisma=Wow, that's [i]some[] splinter! The more I look at it, the deeper in it seems to wriggle.
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_action=[actionSmall]skwrk!
~01~prompt~panel_011~3_loner=[small]Mmph.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_statCharisma=<statCharisma.krfln.loner:<statCharisma.pcfn.loner:Shh.

You have such nice wrists. Now hold still./Here, trust me.>
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_loner=Oh, whatever. I'll get it out later.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~2_loner=It wo--? OW!!
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_statCharisma=This won't hurt a bit..
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~2_loner=Gzzag!
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_statCharisma=Whoops. [face:happy]But here it comes! Painless and easy!
~04~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_loner=[large]ENOUGH!![]

~04~player_chose_one~panel_007~1_narration=<statCharisma> holds a long, wet wood filament up to the light.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_008~1_hothead=<hothead.personality:What an incredible... sorry. It's just an absolute specimen. Can I...?/[face:surprised]And trees are [i]full of these[]...?/If that's a splinter, Mount Helm's a stone.../How'd you get [i]that[] thing stuck in you? It's huge./[face:skeptical]Good to get that out, looking at it. Impressive. Strange./Was going to make fun of you... but that thing's a [i]nail[]!/[face:grim]That's not a little splinter. Good work, <statCharisma>./[face:grim]More like a knife than a splinter./They say the wilds are willful in this part of the world. Hm./[face:skeptical]Who's ever seen a splinter that big? Actually that sounds like a song.../[face:skeptical]Alright, that's no joke.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_009~1_statCharisma=<statCharisma.pcfn.loner:Anyway, here. Memento. To remember your old <statCharisma.mf:dad/mom/renny> once had that magic touch./[face:happy]There you go, <loner.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>. See? Your kid's not useless./Got the blood we share on it.\nWhatever happens, it's a memory./<statCharisma.bookish/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:talking]Keep it, for now. Might want to examine it later./[face:joy]Here! And remember \nwho got it out of you!/[face:grim]Your blood's a bad thing to leave lying around./[face:skeptical]Here, you take it. You can show the <loner.awm:ladies/boys> at the tavern, they'll love it./It's got your blood. Good luck to keep it.>>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_009~2_loner=<statCharisma> slips it into a corded pouch, places it in <loner>'s hands.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_010~1_loner=And with that they carry on to <site>.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_loner=<loner.personality:[face:neutral]Pain's the only issue, and this'll be a good opportunity for me to work on mastering it. Right?/[face:scared][gray]Honestly... I'd rather not have [i]you[] yanking my splinters<statCharisma.pcfn.loner:, <statCharisma.mf:Dad/Mom/Renny>. Were [i]never[] as gentle as you claimed/. Feel like I got payback coming my way/. I remember the last one [i]you[] got/<statCharisma.rfln.loner:, <statCharisma>. For obvious reasons/, <statCharisma>. Not until I'm ready/. Hate for you to see me cry over it/. Not until I'm good and ready>>.../[face:joy]Bunch of fuss over a splinter. Kind of funny, huh?/[face:joke]Since I'm already wounded, though, I could maybe stand in the back? If there's a fight?/[face:skeptical]Feel miserable if we were to stop for this and we find out there's folks at the <site.station> getting devoured. Or worse./[face:talking]Stupid thing. I barely [i]feel[] it. Peh!/[face:talking]I'll be fine. <site>'s where our minds should be./[face:neutral]It's nothing. Random little thing. Come on./Blisters and splinters, scrapes and bruises. \nCome on. We have worse things ahead of us./Anyway, it's only a sign. A soul wants me, who shouldn't. That's what [i]I'll[] be thinking about.[face:happy]/And if a [i]splinter[] gets this reaction, wait 'til a <foes.cdgmt:mealy-blooded Deepist skewers my whole body on a cow-horn./Drauv with a club knocks my skull into the canopy./crazed frogman slurps out my eye./skeleton-claw gouges out my esophagus./big locust-head eats my arm.>>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_hothead=[gray]Psst. <statCharisma>... what's with <loner.mf:his/her/their>-
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~2_statCharisma=[gray]Shhh, I don't know.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~3_loner=Sure. <loner.coward.60:[face:interested]I'll just hope it falls out on its own, first./Will probably just fall out on its own, though.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~4_statCharisma=But, <loner>, next time we get a break...
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_loner=Only it doesn't. Sometime later, <loner> will look and find the splinter gone. But a piercing pain will stitch inside <loner.mf:him/her/them>, a pain that comes and goes.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~2_loner=An ancient elmish soul weaves its roots through <loner.mf:his/her/their> heart.
