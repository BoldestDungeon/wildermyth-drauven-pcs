Right? Am I wrong?/[face:interested]So... Can I ask? Where were the real... I don't know. Deepknights? Bullmonsters? The... I don't know, Shadowblasters and things?/[face:skeptical]Can't believe what a sham it was. What a worthless, meaningless hole full of nothing./You hope that... whatever we did today, the frontiersfolk, they'll have an easier time of things.

~01~~panel_005~2_npc=A recruiting hub is what this place sounds like. Not a meaningful center of their worship, no wide-reaching warren. Am I right?
~01~~panel_005~3_hero=We thought the same.
~01~~panel_006~1_npc=The possibility exists that you've done enough. But even a burnt hand will reach into the pan again, albeit with added caution. I hope... I hope you'll stay ready. And willing to fight. I hope, truly, that no more fighting is needed. I'm... Soon, I'll be home. With my <npc2.mf:brother/sister/sibling>.
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=<npc.fullname>, the <npc.mf:Hillmage/Hillwitch/Hillmage>, dies that next <season>.
~01~~panel_007~2_narration=Celebrated years will pass, failing to last as long as folks wish.
