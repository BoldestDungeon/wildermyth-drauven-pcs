~01~prompt~panel_003~1_volunteer=[small]Pouring out there. And lightning. \nYou were right.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_narration=The way to <site> follows dead roads, long washed to chalkstone, wheelscars, and memory.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_narration=The uneven fields beyond this gorge get swampy, especially in <season>. \n<overlandTile.bghps:They wad around the elbows of <overlandTile> like soaked blankets./They stretch a great distance, too sodden to invite a large settlement./Some know these highlands by their colloquial name: the Drowned Hills./They sink under the shadow of <overlandTile>./They slope down into a network of brown lakes and bogs.>
~01~prompt~panel_004~3_bookish=Got this little \ncave, though.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_friend=<friend.coward/goofball/hothead/leader/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]Yeah, worries me. What do [i]you[] think?/[face:joke]Someone's hungry for an adventure./Agreed.

A quick look should be safe enough./Yeah, wasn't opened up like this, before. Unless I just missed it.>
~01~prompt~panel_006~3_narration=On a forceful gust, the rain comes chasing them. \nThe rocks slicken, fragrant and dark.

I'm going in./I'm not standing out here and ruining my gear./[face:talking]At least let's talk without getting soaked, yeah?/What's wrong? You two're scared of the dark, now?/[face:grim]We're getting to the end of our day's light, as it is.

~01~prompt~panel_019~1_bookish=We're taking a longer look, I guess...
~01~prompt~panel_019~2_friend=<friend.coward/goofball/hothead/loner/snark/80:[face:interested]Caution's still important.

~01~prompt~panel_020~1_greedy=Hey. Is this worked stone?

~01~prompt~panel_023~1_bookish=Yeah. The way forks. We got stairs here.
~01~prompt~panel_024~1_bookish=And this's a... looks random, but... some other passage. Cold draft from there. Very cold.
~01~prompt~panel_025~4_greedy=<greedy.bookish/greedy/poet/romantic/60:Stonework's old, but you can see it was done with care.

~01~prompt~panel_026~2_friend=<friend.coward/hothead/60:Well, my question is... when's the next cave-in?/[face:dubious]Did we come here to explore, suddenly?/Careful. Look under enough rocks and you [i]will[] find a snake.[face:skeptical]>
~01~prompt~panel_026~3_bookish=<friend.coward/hothead/60:<bookish.bookish/coward/healer/hothead/snark/60:The entrance was brittle, freshly exposed.

~04~choice_three~panel_001~2_darken=Take the ancient stairs.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_friend=Come on. We clear the rubble, maybe we'll be back here...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_bookish=<bookish.personality2:[face:grim]I find your lack of curiosity in this case surprising./Mind if I stand at the back, while you do it?/Do you have a coin?

~05~player_chose_one~panel_005~4_narration=As they go, they pluck valuable minerals from the pile.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_007~1_greedy=Looks clear. Storm's running west.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_008~2_narration=As their eyes adjust, they assemble above the sodden fields \nthat lead to <site>.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_009~3_greedy=Now's the time to make a crossing, I'd think. While the weather's clear...

~05~player_chose_one~panel_010~4_bookish=That's fine. It's true, we won't have light for much longer, or this lapse in the rain. We'll be back this way, I suppose.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_011~1_narration=And though they intend to return...
~05~player_chose_one~panel_011~2_narration=The idea of recrossing sloshing fields to delve into this collapse-prone cave fails to inspire much enthusiasm.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_012~2_narration=Seasons pass, storms crash and calm, and none of them ever finds the buried crossroads again.
~06~player_chose_commune~panel_001~2_greedy=<greedy.goofball/loner/poet/romantic/60:[face:happy]What do you think's making it cold like that? Big subterranean lake? With big blind white fish?

I could look ahead./[face:talking]A cold tunnel in the mountains. It has a certain flavor to it. Like a yarn we'll tell for years./[face:talking]A cold tunnel in the mountains.

~06~player_chose_commune~panel_002~5_narration=Inside the passage, the chill turns sharp and invasive.
~06~player_chose_commune~panel_003~1_narration=It colonizes their hair, erecting a thousand \ntiny castles of frost that melt at a touch.
