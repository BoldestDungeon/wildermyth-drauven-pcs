Why else [i]would[] you stay?[face:skeptical]/I understand.[face:neutral] Now, whether or not your behavior called for it... is something I don't know. It's painful, though, I'm sure. It must've been quite a time ago. You're still here. For a reason?/[face:skeptical]Eh, none of that's much surprise. People'll bully you if you don't make them stop. Kind of cowardly though, sticking around down here? Or you got some reason for not returning?/Can tell you're someone with a lengthy history. And I'm sure we aren't even beginning to understand: your past, your point of view. If I were you, I'd have left this place. If I didn't [i]want[] to be here. Why haven't you?[face:neutral]/[face:grim]Mm. I'm familiar with how people are. If it was me, I'd probably be out of here as soon as I thought I wasn't watched. Go my own way. You like it here, though? Or why did you stay?/Archer robins lay their eggs low beneath fruit trees. Their chicks, of all birds, fly earliest. Folks say it's because they're forced to stare up at all they desire. I'd think you'd have flown, if there was something you desired. But you stay. Is there a reason?/It's a repeating story. Each telling... feels a little sadder. How the ugl--or I mean--the [i]unique[] faces, folks take to calling [i]Monster,[] and run them from town. You don't have to let that be the end. You know you can live up there again? Why wouldn't you?[face:interested]/Yeah, and you do sound blameless, and completely in control of your emotions. So that's weird. You know, there's a lot of world out there. I'm sure no one would know if you left this place. Why do you stay?>
