~01~prompt~panel_001~1_friend=Did you see the huge moth that landed in <leader>'s hair earlier today?
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_poet=How could I not?
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_friend=And you weren't going to say anything?
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_friend=<leader.mf:He/She/They> walked around with <friend.romantic/snark:it/that thing sticking out at a jaunty angle> for like an hour.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_friend=<friend.snark/coward/romantic:Hey. Tell me a story./You think you could tell a story?/Tell me a story. Before the embers die out.>
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_friend=<friend.snark/coward/romantic:You're the <poet.mf:guy/gal/one> with the stories. Right?/I don't need my last thoughts tonight to be of <foes.plural>./I just want to spend some time in a world where everything... fits together nicely.>
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_poet=Well, what would you like to hear?
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_friend=Tell me the one about the Trickster Moon.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_friend=How about "The Fire <npc.mf:King/Queen/Mage> and the Raindrop?"
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_friend=Nothing too fantastic. Just tell me something that happened to you.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_narration=<poet> told of how the Moon used to be a dark hunk of stone, until it tricked the Sun into giving up some of his light.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_poet=And the Sun, as you always suspected, <poet.goofball/romantic/bookish:is a bit of a glory-hoarding jerk./is an envious sort./can't stand the thought of anyone approaching [i]a fraction[] his brillance.>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_poet=The Moon knew that a fair fight was out of the question.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_poet=So while the Sun was distracted, the Moon fled over the horizon, drawn by a team of fireflies.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_005~2_poet=And to this day they take refuge in the night sky, shining where the Sun will never find them. Giving their blessings to those who move swiftly through the shadows.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_narration=<poet> described a bitter <npc.mf:sorcerer/sorceress/sorcerer> who ruled <npc.mf:his/her/their> realm with a fiery hand. One day, a raindrop fell onto <npc.mf:his/her/their> plate and told <npc.mf:him/her/them> of the suffering <npc.mf:his/her/their> acts had caused.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_poet="Go on, little teardrop!" <npc.mf:he/she/they> laughed, and puffed a warm wind to dry it right up.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_poet=But another raindrop fell, on <npc.mf:his/her/their> table this time. This one <npc.mf:he/she/they> shriveled with a flick of <npc.mf:his/her/their> fingernail.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_poet=But still more fell.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_poet=The rain fell with one voice, rising, rising, and eventually the Flame <npc.mf:King/Queen/Mage> and all <npc.mf:his/her/their> ashery were washed away in a great torrent.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_006~2_narration=The <npc.mf:sorcerer/sorceress/sorcerer> began shooting gouts of flame and screaming the heat from the earth, but it wasn't enough.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_friend=<friend.romantic/snark:And the raindrops... all lived happily ever after?/A torrent... of [i]teamwork.[]>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_008~1_friend=<friend.romantic/snark:As those in inspiring tales tend to?/Which was the [i]real[] treasure all along.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_009~1_poet=You asked for a story, you got a story, alright?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_003~1_poet=Okay.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_004~1_narration=<poet> told <friend> about a bluejay who used to perch just outside <poet.mf:his/her/their> kitchen window. The bird's trust was more easily won than that of most wild creatures, especially with the nuts from <poet>'s pantry.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_004~2_poet=<poet.romantic/goofball:Sapphire, I called him... jays demand regal names, you know?/I called him Scuttlebutt, even though he probably wouldn't have approved.>
~07~player_chose_three~panel_005~1_poet=He always cocked his head, as if he were listening.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_006~1_poet=And there was a lot for him to hear. <poet.poet.60:It was a time of breaking-downs and movings-on./It was a tough time for me.>
~07~player_chose_three~panel_009.(friend_is_coward)~1_friend=Please tell me he doesn't get eaten by a cat next.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_010.(friend_is_romantic)~1_friend=So what happened to little <poet.romantic/goofball:Sapphire/Scuttlebutt>?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_011.(friend_is_snark)~1_friend=Do I... want to know what happened to him?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_012~1_poet=<friend.coward/romantic/snark:Not that I saw. He did eventually stop coming./Same thing that happens to <poet.poet.50:all who walk or fly this path, I imagine./every bluejay, I'd guess.>/Same thing that happens to <poet.poet.60:all who walk or fly this path, I imagine./every bluejay, I'd guess.>>
~07~player_chose_three~panel_013~1_poet=Funny thing though. The last time he visited, he brought me a present.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_014~1_poet=A stone. Not too big, but almost perfectly round. I've kept it ever since, wearing its surface smooth with any worries or thoughts I have.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_015~1_friend=<friend.romantic/snark:...You think it could be magic?/...It ever given you any good advice?>
~07~player_chose_three~panel_015~2_poet=<poet.poet.80:Eh. If rocks have any insight, they speak it more deeply than a person can hear./Nah.>
~07~player_chose_three~panel_016~1_poet=It listens, and that's enough.
