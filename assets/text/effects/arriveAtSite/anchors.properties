~01~prompt~panel_002~1_friend=Okay, I've got one. Favorite... fruit.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hero=<hero.personality:[hero.face:interested]Tomato is botanically a fruit, does that count?/[face:interested]Oh dear... Blueberry? Blackberry? Cranberry? One of the berries, probably.../As long as it's in a pie, I don't care./Ever had a cliffcherry? They're rare, but worth splurging on at least once in your life./Mulberries, fresh off the tree. Best part of summer./[friend.face:interested][face:grim]Raspberry. No question. Best berry out there./Give me a good, upstanding apple any day./[face:interested]Uh.. apple./[friend.face:dubious]The fruits of one's labors are sweetest./I once had something called a persimmon. The flavor was subtle, wrapped itself around your tongue. I still think about it./As long as it's in a pie, I don't care.>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_friend=<friend.pcfn.hero:Ah, I remember that now./Ah, I remember that now./Ah, I remember that now./<hero.personality:[face:skeptical]Sigh, I should've known... You know what, sure. It counts./[face:joy]It's a hard question. I understand./<friend.goofball/healer/romantic/60:[face:joy]/[face:joy]/[face:joy]/[face:talking]>Fair enough./[face:joke]Careful there, your fancy taste is showing./I'll let you know next time I spot one./Not questioning./[face:joke]As opposed to one of those morally questionable peaches?/[face:skeptical]I knew you were going to say apple. Why did I know that?/[face:dubious][hero.face:happy]Cute./Wish I remembered fruit that well./<friend.goofball/healer/romantic/60:[face:joy]/[face:joy]/[face:joy]/[face:talking]>Fair enough.>>
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hero=<friend.bookish/goofball/hothead/80:Next up, a difficult one!/[face:joke]Alright, you're gonna love this one./[face:joke]...Alright, got one. You ready?/Okay, my turn.>
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hero=Favorite... thing to fight.
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_friend=That's like asking my favorite rash.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_hero=[i]Least[] favorite, then.
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_friend=Mmm... might have to be <foes.plural>.
~01~prompt~panel_008~2_hero=Is that because they're over the next hill?
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_friend=It’s… <foes.cdgmt:the idea that they used to be people. It makes you wonder what horrid thing you could become if your soul got twisted the wrong way when you were young./a beast or a construct is just blindly destroying. But Drauven, when you get close enough to look in their eyes, you see [i]hatred[] staring back at you./the “ick” factor—even worse than Thrixl. They don't just move, they [i]spread.[] They’re like walking diseases./I can never quite tell if they’re alive or not. It’s distracting. One of these days, it's going to mess with <hero.whm:my aim/my aim/the magic>./it’s like the air changes when they get close. You feel your own breath might betray you.>
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_hero=And here I am, making a career out of them.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_friend=<friend.age.40:As old as I’m getting, sometimes/I’m not that old, right? Sometimes> I wonder if it’s not too late to start over somewhere.
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_friend=I wouldn't, though. Realistically.
~01~prompt~panel_012~3_friend=<friend.goofball/snark/hothead/greedy/80:You bumblebees need me too badly./You bumblebees need me too badly./You bumblebees need me too badly./You bumblebees need me too badly./It’d reek of abandonment.>
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_hero=Well, we appreciate that.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_friend=What about you? What keeps you here?
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hero=<hero.personality:To preserve the world we’ve been given./[face:interested]People are counting on us./[face:happy]I just want a world where people can be carefree./The opportunity to make history./The belief that peace can be found./<foes.plural> need to be stopped. Simple as that./A duty to protect./Got a job to do./[face:interested]Nothing less than the dreams of all yet to come./[face:interested]Upholding what’s best in the world./Turns out this is important.>
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_hero=Honestly? <hero.personality:I’m too curious for my own good./Sheer terror./So I don’t have to get a real job./The gear./The guilt./Means I don’t have to be polite./It gives me a sense of control./It gets you out of civilization./I’m just following a breeze./Feeling special./Got nothing better to do.>
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_hero=You mean other than you?
~05~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_hero=<hero.personality:The history of the Yondering Lands is a precious, intricate thing. We inherited it, and we will preserve it against destruction until the day we can hand it over to our children./Whether that was a wise decision on their part isn't for me to question. But now it’s up to us to follow through on... whatever cosmic promise we made by picking up these weapons. And “us” includes me./<foes.plural> don’t seem very excited about that world, though. They seem more set on a “joyless hellscape” kind of world. So we can’t let them ruin it for everybody else, right?/You want to be immortalized in the lore of this land? You’ve got to earn it. And that’s what I’m doing— what I’ll keep doing until it’s finally time to sit back and enjoy what I helped save./People have it in them. But no one can be at their best with <foes.plural> creeping around. Get those out of the way, and then people will show you the world they’re capable of building./ They'll <foes.cdgmt:spread their rot over everything otherwise./burn it all to the ground otherwise./turn the world into a writhing mass of wrath otherwise./overrun everything otherwise./pick apart the seams of the world otherwise.> And if an ill-tempered <hero.mf:man/woman/hero> with <hero.weaponType:a sword/an axe/a club/a spear/a bow/a crossbow/a dagger/a wand/a staff/a weird arm> can keep that from happening, then maybe we’re luckier than we deserve to be. /I'm lucky enough to be able and willing to fight, and I owe it to the land that brought me up. What others sacrificed for me, I'll sacrifice in turn./It’s not about convincing people that everything will be alright. It’s about making everything alright. And once it’s alright, you can go home./Dreams not yet dreamt are the most fragile of things. So we ensure those dreams are kept safe from whatever nightmares creep in around the edges./Beauty over ugliness. Love over fear. And the joyful song of life over whatever <foes.cdgmt:spore-smelling/foul-scaled/wet, green/dusty-boned/twisty-jawed> death a <foes.singular> peddles./Most things in this world matter less than you’d think. But this is one thing that matters a lot.>
~05~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_friend=When you put it like that, it sounds... big.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_hero=Sure.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_003~2_hero=It is.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_hero=I don’t know if that helps, or if it’s too much pressure.
~05~player_chose_one~panel_004~2_hero=But it helps me <hero.goofball/loner/hothead/snark/greedy/80:[face:joke]on those days when I remember exactly what I’m walking into./when even battle starts to feel like drudgery./when even battle starts to feel like drudgery./when even battle starts to feel like drudgery./when even battle starts to feel like drudgery./when we get close enough to hear <foes.cdgmt:those echoing chants./those savage calls./those gurgly bellows./the clanking./the mad humming.>>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_hero=<hero.personality:The vast story of our age is being played out as we speak. And I simply must know how a good story ends, even if it takes me through unwise woods./It’s shameful, but… I may be in this for my own sake more than I’d care to admit. A sense of self-preservation can crack a long whip./[face:happy]I'm not exactly marketable, and who else is going to tolerate me? At least you all let me stick around as long as I don’t make things worse./[face:happy]Ever notice how much better dressed we are than anyone else in town? Plus, it’s nice to have your feats on display. Then you don’t have to awkwardly work them into conversation./Not the warmhearted answer I’d like to give. But it’s for the best… if I didn’t have that constant pang of not doing enough, would I do anything at all?/[face:skeptical]Secret for you—turns out you can be a massive dung-bat as long as you’re doing an important job and doing it well. Nobody's going to give the <foes.singular>-killer a hard time./Maybe I’m delusional, thinking we can save the Lands one <foes.singular> at a time. But that’s the extent of each decision I can make. I have to believe it’ll be enough, or I can’t make any decisions at all./I know civilization is what we’re fighting for. And I’m fine with that, but I am also fine with civilization flourishing… not right on top of me. So I’m out here./The breeze blows me, and I see where it leads. It’s led me here, but sometimes I feel like I had very little to do with that./Who doesn’t want to feel special? And how many people get the chance to actually [i]be[] special? If I gave that up, what would be left?/Don’t tell <leader>, <leader.mf:he’ll/she’ll/they’ll> get all judgy about that sort of thing.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_hero=<hero.personality:[face:skeptical]Among other more… virtuous reasons. Of course./[face:sad]The heroic veneer only goes so deep./[face:interested]Oh, and uh… hero. Duty. Yondering Lands something something./[face:dubious]Oh, like you’ve never done it./[face:interested]Is that… not how everyone works?/[face:dubious]Make that face all you like. It’s true./[face:surprised]Er, I mean, of course it’s enough! Don’t listen to me./[face:skeptical]Wait, what were you hoping to hear?/[face:sad]Your battlemate’s a flighty little bird, it turns out./[face:interested]Aside from a bunch of <foes.plural> overrunning everything, I mean./[face:skeptical]Don’t tell me you’re judging too.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_hero=Diplomatic of you.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_005~1_friend=No, no, I respect that.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_006~1_friend=<friend.goofball/snark/hothead:I'm not exactly a pillar of shining light myself./I'm not exactly a pillar of shining light myself./I'm not exactly a pillar of shining light myself./You’re not afraid to dig up those parts of yourself and examine them.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_006~2_friend=<friend.goofball/snark/hothead:Got enough enemies out there, don't make yourself one too./Got enough enemies out there, don't make yourself one too./Got enough enemies out there, don't make yourself one too./There’re things other than battle that take bravery, too.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_hero=<friend.goofball/snark/hothead:Fair. <foes.plural> do a fine job of that./Fair. <foes.plural> do a fine job of that./Fair. <foes.plural> do a fine job of that./Battle’s probably the biggest one right now though.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_007~2_hero=We’re getting close.
~07~player_chose_three~panel_001~1_hero=So many things, really... <friend.whm:Those toned arms/that lithe form/those spellbinding gazes>, that dazzling smile, the way you whisper my name before a fight...
~07~player_chose_three~panel_001~2_friend=<friend.bookish/snark/hothead/80:That's not an answer, that's random flattery./That's not an answer, that's random flattery./That's not an answer, that's random flattery./Shush! <leader>'s gonna hear.>
~07~player_chose_three~panel_002~1_hero=Plus, what kind of <hero.mf:man/woman/partner> would I be if I left you to get picked up by some <hero.mf:beefy/tarty/flirty> <foes.singular>?
~07~player_chose_three~panel_002~2_friend=<foes.cdgmt:That mushroomy musk [i]is[] irresistible./Ehh, they're cute, but they come on a little strong for my tastes./Mm, true. A “come hither” wave from those tentacles and I’m toast./You know I can’t resist a good ribcage./[i]Come weeeave a little web in my heaaart…[]>
