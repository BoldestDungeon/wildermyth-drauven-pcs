~01~prompt~panel_001~1_narration=<company> had passed so many abandoned homesteads as they trekked through <overlandTile>...
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_narration=...that to see a light and a ribbon of smoke ahead was as surprising as it was welcome.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_leader=<leader.leader/hothead/bookish/coward:One little haven still staked out, hm?/Not intimidated by a few <foes.plural>. My kind of people./Their tenacity is admirable, I'll say that much./Why in the world would you stick around, when...?>
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_healer=<healer.healer/bookish/romantic/greedy:[face:interested]I don't know whether it's inspiring or heartbreaking./I suppose they haven't been driven out yet, anyway./[face:interested]I don't know whether it's inspiring or heartbreaking./Folks can hang on a while when they've got something to lose.>
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_leader=Well, let's hope they're hospitable to boot.
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_healer='Evening. Have to say, we weren't expecting a friendly face this close to <site>.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_leader=<leader.leader/hothead/bookish/coward:[face:skeptical]Assuming you're friendly./[face:grim]You [i]are[] friendly, right?/[face:skeptical]Assuming you're a friendly sort./[face:interested]You, uh, are friendly? Right?>
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_npc=What? Oh, of course. I... sorry.
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_npc=Come in, come in.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_npc=Normally I'd offer you some milk or cheese, but things being as they are...
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_healer=If you've got a roof and a fireplace, we're already appreciative.
~01~prompt~panel_014~1_leader=You kept cows, then? Or sheep?
~01~prompt~panel_015~1_npc=Kept...  Right.
~01~prompt~panel_015~2_npc=Um, cows. My livelihood.
~01~prompt~panel_016~1_leader=I'm surprised anyone would hang around <site> with Gorgon corruption so close. Especially a cattle farmer.
~01~prompt~panel_017~1_npc=The thing is, those cows and me, we depend on each other.
~01~prompt~panel_019~1_leader=I wouldn't abandon them.
~01~prompt~panel_020~1_npc=And just like they wouldn't abandon me...
~01~prompt~panel_021~1_leader=<leader.leader/hothead/bookish/coward:[face:surprised]What exactly is going on here?/[face:rage]That better not be what it looks like!/[face:skeptical]What exactly is [i]this?[]/[face:scared]What exactly is [i]this?[]>
~01~prompt~panel_021~2_actionSmall=Mrrrm?
~01~prompt~panel_023.(monster_exists)~1_healer=Reminds me a little of a certain hero I know...
~01~prompt~panel_024.(monster_exists)~1_leader=<leader.leader/hothead/bookish/coward:[face:grim]This isn't like that./[face:angry]Don't go downplaying it./[face:grim]That doesn't mean anything./[face:surprised]This isn't like that.> It's different in beasts!
~01~prompt~panel_025~1_npc=I'll take you out back.
~01~prompt~panel_025~2_leader=<leader.leader/hothead/bookish/coward:[face:grim]...You know the sorts of questions we have to ask now, right?/[face:angry]Is there a good reason we shouldn't <leader.whm:run this thing through/put one between this thing's eyes/blast this thing out of existence> right now?/[face:skeptical]I want to give you the benefit of the doubt here, so can you explain?/[face:scared]Should we be getting out our weapons right now, or...?>
~01~prompt~panel_025~3_actionSmall=Mrghoo...
~01~prompt~panel_026~1_npc=I was hoping to introduce you to the ladies and their [i]condition[] a little more delicately. But long story short, I'm glad they held out until somebody like you came along.
~01~prompt~panel_027~1_hero=Like us?
~01~prompt~panel_028~1_npc=Well you're... you're the ones who help. You have magic, don't you? And experience with... You're the ones who do the impossible.
~01~prompt~panel_029~1_leader=<leader.leader/hothead/bookish/coward:Not in the way you think, I'm afraid./It's not that kind of magic, farmer./There are different degrees of impossible, it turns out./[face:interested]We can knock out a den of Gorgons on a good day, but that's about as far as we go, turns out.>
~01~prompt~panel_030~1_leader=I hate to tell you this, but the cows' fate was sealed a while ago.
~01~prompt~panel_031~1_leader=<leader.leader/hothead/bookish/coward:[face:grim]They're more of a danger to you by the day. And when they finally turn, it won't be pretty./[face:angry]And keeping them around any longer than you need to isn't sentimental, it's a death-wish./[face:grim]Keeping them around is a risk that frankly borders on irresponsible./[face:scared]And you know the endgame, right? You've seen those frothing, savage things lurking in the <overlandTile.biome>. It's awful.>
~01~prompt~panel_032~1_actionSmall=Mrrorgh...
~01~prompt~panel_033~1_npc=You couldn't at least take a look at them?
~01~prompt~panel_034~1_npc=See if there was something...?
~01~prompt~panel_036~1_leader=<healer>, you've got that look. <healer.healer/bookish/romantic/greedy:That sympathetic look./That curious look./That overly-noble look./That odds-weighing look.>
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_healer=We could study them, perhaps?
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_leader=<leader.leader/hothead/bookish/coward:No. We do what must be done./No. We do what this <npc.mf:man/woman/person> can't. Or won't./No. We do what must be done./No. We can't let this get any worse.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_healer=<healer.healer/bookish/romantic/greedy:It's the least we could do. We're in this to help people, and here's an opportunity staring us in the face. Mooing sadly./When else would we get a chance to fiddle with a Gorgon affliction in an early stage? I know I've got questions that could possibly be answered./If you heard someone telling this story afterwards, the right choice is clear. I want them to say that <healer> did all <healer.mf:he,she,they> could to save the innocent./Think about the upside. Knowledge? Or better? It'd be a shame to leave something that valuable on the table.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_leader=<healer.healer/bookish/romantic/greedy:"Helping" was not the phrase in my head. "Enabling this nonsense" was closer./Questions like, "How many Gorgonoid cattle can one group of heroes take on?"/Sure, but what's the ending of that story?/As long as it's a risk you can afford to take.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_healer=We'll take a few days and look them over. It's not like we have an official appointment time at <site>, anyway.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_npc="Thank you" doesn't sound like much, but thank you.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_005~1_narration=<npc> put them up well, and <healer> <healer.healer/bookish/romantic/greedy:sat with the cattle, becoming familiar with them/observed the cattle closely/poured <healer.mf:his,her,their> heart into observing the cattle/appraised the cattle carefully> for a few days.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_006~1_healer=Well, we know more about how the curse [i]progresses[] in beasts.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_007~1_healer=Nothing about how it [i]stops[], unfortunately.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_008~1_hero=That's something, though.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_010~1_hero=...Unless you had [i]actually[] hoped to cure them?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_011~1_healer="<healer.healer/bookish/greedy/romantic:Pure-hearted/Clever/Savvy/Valiant> ol' <healer> has broken the Gorgon Menace wide open, everyone! Let's buy <healer.mf:him,her,'em> a round and declare a holiday?"
~04~player_chose_one~panel_012~1_narration=Suddenly...
~04~player_chose_one~panel_012~2_darken=[action]Mooorrrgggghhh...
~04~player_chose_one~panel_012~3_darken=[action][aqua]Grrrmmm...
~04~player_chose_one~panel_014~1_leader=<leader.leader/hothead/bookish/coward:[face:surprised]/[face:rage]/[face:surprised]/[face:scared]>Change of plans, folks! We're not going to <site> anymore.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_015~1_leader=<site> got impatient and decided to come to us!
~04~player_chose_one~panel_015~2_action=[aqua]Garuuu!
~04~player_chose_one~panel_015~3_actionSmall=Grommph
~04~player_chose_one~panel_016~1_actionLarge=[darkAqua]Crash!
~04~player_chose_one~panel_017~1_action=MMMROGHH!
~04~player_chose_one~panel_018~2_leader=<leader.leader/hothead/bookish/coward:[face:angry]Oh, now that their [i]friends[] are here, they don't want to be left out./[face:rage]'Bout time, Horns! I was wondering when you were gonna show us the goods./[face:grim]<healer>... I'm afraid it's finally time to wrap up the "studies."/[face:scared]Oh, and the cows are... destiny is a rascally thing, isn't she?>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_018~3_action=[aqua]Groarr!
~06~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_leader=<leader.leader/hothead/bookish/coward:I know it's unpleasant, but has anything about Gorgons been pleasant so far?/Unless you want to sit around and wait for this to get a whole lot harder./[face:grim]I know it's unpleasant, but has anything regarding Gorgons been pleasant so far?/[face:interested]We've fought these things. We've seen how nasty they get.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_leader=<leader.leader/hothead/bookish/coward:Sometimes sacrifices have to be made for a greater good. We've made quite a few ourselves./Because I don't know if you have the means to deal with full-on Gorgonoids, or if you were planning to have us put [i]our[] lives at risk, but both of those outcomes sound crummy to me./You've shown a great deal of kindness and mercy. But consider that ending this peacefully may ultimately be the most merciful option./[face:interested]Trust me when I say you don't want it to come to that. Each one we have to deal with is another potential disaster.>
~06~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_narration=After the grisly deed was done, <npc> topped off the group's supplies and pointed them towards <site>.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_007~1_leader=Hey.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_008~1_leader=There'll always be more cows.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_009~1_healer=And <overlandTile> should be a much better place for them soon, if all goes well.
~06~player_chose_two~panel_011~1_npc=...Hope it does.
