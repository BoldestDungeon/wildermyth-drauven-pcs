~01~prompt~panel_001~2_healer=...gggggggrrrrrggggggsssssss...
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_healer=Did anyone else hear that?
~01~prompt~panel_002~2_hothead=Hear what?
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_healer=I don't know, it was like some kind of... there it is again!
~01~prompt~panel_003~2_healer=...ggggrrggggssss...
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_healer=It sounds hurt. Maybe we should look for it.
~01~prompt~panel_004~2_hothead=Probably just some animal.
~01~prompt~panel_005~1_hothead=<hothead.coward/hothead/snark/60:\nWhat for? What would we even do if we found it?/\nWhy bother? We've still got a long day before we can make camp./\nSure. Why not? It's not like we're trying to get somewhere to save someone or anything.../\nSeems a little off-mission, doesn't it?>
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_healer=Hello? Hello. Are you--*gasp*!
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hothead=What is it? What did you...
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_none=...ggggrrrgggssss...
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_healer=It's a child!
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_healer=It's a DRAUVEN!
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_hothead=...ggggrrrgggssss...
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hothead=WHAT!!??
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_healer=I think we should help it.
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_healer=It's young. It's hurt.
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_hothead=It's a DRAUVEN!
~01~prompt~panel_010~3_none=...ggggrrrgggssss...
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_healer=It won't survive the night!
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_hothead=Good! It's a monster!
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_healer=Letting it die would make US the monsters. It's not a threat to anyone right now. It's scared and in need. We should help it.
~01~prompt~panel_012~2_healer=...gggrrsssss...
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_healer=I WANT to help it.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_hothead=Ugh. Fine. We'll camp here and "help" it...
~02~choice_one~panel_001~2_healer=<healer.eventRoll:roll_one|difficulty_one>
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_hothead=We can't waste our time on this.. We have to move on.
~04~choice_three~panel_001~1_hothead=Who said anything about "letting" it die...
~04~choice_three~panel_001~2_healer=<healer.eventRoll:roll_three|difficulty_three>
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_001~1_healer=If we're going to help it, I'll need a fire. <Volunteer>, can you get me water and bandages?
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_001~2_hothead=<hothead.coward/hothead/snark/60:\n...just hope it doesn't bring more of them down on us.../\n...*grumble, grumble* bleeding-heart *grumble, grumble*/\nWhat's next? We adopt it? Make it a team mascot?/\n...if this goes wrong, just remember I [b][i]told[][] you so...>

~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_002~1_healer=Shhhhh... it's all right... you're going to be all right...
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_002~2_healer=...ggggrrrgggssss...
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_003~1_healer=All through the night, <Healer> tended to the injured Drauven, until...
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_003~2_none=...gggrrsssss...
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_004~1_hothead=Hey, wake up! Where's the thing?
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_004~2_healer=Huh? I dozed off--it's gone!
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_005~1_hothead=Figures. Skulking away, just like a Drauven.
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_005~2_healer=It must have run off during the night...
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_006~1_hothead=<hothead.coward/hothead/snark/60:\nWell it better not be strong enough to warn its tribe and ambush us later.../\nGlad you're happy... 'cause some day we'll probably meet it again and have to kill it./\nGreat. What should we do next? Craft extra gears for the Morthagi...?/\nWell... I hope that's the last we see of it...>
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_006~2_healer=But it didn't hurt us. And if it was strong enough to get away... that means we [b][i]did[][] help it.
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_007~1_hothead=Let's pack up. We've got a long road ahead of us...
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_008~1_hothead=Hopefully we can make up the lost time...
~05~player_chose_one.test_pass~panel_008~2_healer=Good-bye... good luck...

~06~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_004~2_healer=It didn't... it didn't make it.
~06~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_005~1_hothead=Oh.
~06~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_006~1_hothead=<hothead.coward/hothead/snark/60:\nI guess it's... it's probably safest this way. Right?/\nLook... it took guts to do that. To stand up to the rest of us like that./\nWell... I guess that's what happens when you try to do a little good in this crappy world./\nI'm... sorry. I know you were just trying to help.>
~06~player_chose_one.test_fail~panel_007~1_healer=Let's just get out of here. There's still a long road ahead of us...

~07~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_volunteer=<Healer>, <hothead.mf:he's/she's/they're> right. We have to go. It's for the best...
