Would've been a nice consolation prize. Something to remember <npc.mf:him/her> by./Yes, yes. Everything's alright. Let's get home. To a tavern, and we'll see whose belly can stretch roundest./What I get for not following my instinct.[face:angry] A bowl of waterlogged beans. Won't ever sit right with me./What age did I start believing in love? Long time ago, I guess. Long years. Longer, and longer, and longer./You two eat. I'll do another walk down to the water. You can leave the fire. Or bank it. Doesn't matter, I guess./A bear is a solitary creature, for the most part. No wonder they sleep so long./Beans. At the end of the night, I'm here with beans and a beige tent. Ah well./Not sure what we call adventures, these days. We always wind up the same. Just older.>

Little respect for the wildborn and their domain.[face:talking]/[face:skeptical]Chasing flashes gets folks lost, or worse. Dragged down to Netherflare? Anyway.../[face:happy]Or do you two want to end up with fish-heads? Come on./Sometimes we have to stop ourselves from chasing whatever's bright. [face:skeptical][i]I[] struggle with it, of course. But.../[face:talking]Maybe sounds miserable and boring, and I get it, but we have to show some respect. Plus.../[face:grim]Honestly, you two can be like dogs, sometimes. Chasing anything you get a nose for. Remember?/Way I see it, this territory's <npc.mf:his/hers> to roam, and we're only passers through. Let's be respectful./[face:grim]This is exactly the behavior [i]I[] get annoyed with. When everyone thinks your world is theirs to touch and remark upon. Anyway.../Let's not stick our clumsy feet into clear water. Just appreciate the vision. And anyway.../[face:interested]Glues our hearts to our ribs sometimes: desire. But clutching after things is a good way to warp, or bend, or break them./And look, I get it.[face:skeptical] Just seems rude to start claiming this or that, or go running after <npc.mf:men/women> with our hearts on fire.> We have a job to finish.

Why am I like this?/[face:skeptical]I was on edge all day, tell you the truth.

I was on edge all day. Thought for sure we'd find some monster-draped lumberyard./[face:neutral]Ever think about not returning? Listening to the sound of a fire and crickets...
