~01~prompt~panel_001~1_leader=Hm? Sounds like there's some commotion going on down there.

~01~prompt~panel_004~1_volunteer=*sigh*[face:sad]
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_volunteer=Ah![face:surprised]
~01~prompt~panel_007~1_volunteer=You're the ones who helped us build this outpost, right? [face:interested]
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_leader=<leader.GOOFBALL.50:[face:happy]That's right! We're <Company>!/Indeed. <Company>.>
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_hero=<hero.goofball/healer/leader/greedy/snark:[face:joke]Don't wear the name out!/[face:happy]It's good to see this place flourishing!/[face:happy]I'm glad that we were able to help./[face:grim]It wasn't cheap, you know./[face:skeptical][#999999]Your Yandric is weirdly good...>
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_volunteer=Right... Well, I guess I'd better get back to training then...
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_leader=Wait! Those guys... were they giving you trouble?
~01~prompt~panel_009~2_volunteer=<leader.fluentInDruvwail:[green]Wha?/Pla?>
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_volunteer=It's nothing new. Don't get me wrong, they have mellowed down since you helped build this place up. But they still get on my tail whenever I'm not training or eating. [face:sad]
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_actionSmall=<leader.fluentInDruvwail:[green]@&$#/gwec>
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_volunteer=It's just... <volunteer.bookish/coward/goofball/healer/hothead/leader/loner/greedy/poet/romantic/snark: This constant training really dulls the mind. I do want to help the outpost, but I'll never get the time to pursue my studies like this.[face:dubious]/I hate the feeling of dread. This constant training solves nothing. If I have to face my fear, I'd rather go out and get it done with.[face:angry]/Everyone's a big stick in the mud! I want the chance to be myself, and I can't stand these guys weighing me down![face:rage]/We're not really helping anyone but ourselves here. I suggested we should offer more help to the humans coming through here, but they only see it as a waste of time...[face:grim]/They're complete and utter hypocrites! I saw <npc> slacking off the other day! And don't get me started on <npc2>! But sure, let's complain about the <volunteer.mf:guy/girl/one> who took the time out to learn the funny human speak![face:rage]/I've been thinking about strategizing, maybe working with the humans to come up with a plan to take our enemy head on. But they think that the only way to success and honor is through brute force.[face:grim]/They never give me any time to myself. I can't deal with this, having to fight with my tribe every waking moment.[face:hit]/The deeven in charge here doesn't even share out our resources! I'm expected to fight for them guys for elk shavings?! I don't know how the others keep motivated![face:rage]/Sometimes I feel like a wayward breeze amidst a gusty storm, lost in a tribe that sees no beauty beyond muscle and labor. While my kin chase battles, my heart yearns for the dance of words, the artful tapestry of poetry. [face:sad]/There's no-one here I click with, and ever since we've become open to the outside world, my mind's been wandering away from my spear practice... My true mate, maybe they're out there?[face:sad]/They're honestly unbearable to train with. <leader.fluentInDruvwail:You've heard these guys, right?/If you spoke Druvwail, you'd know>. If I can't trust these guys to make up a good insult, how are they going to be in a real fight?[face:dubious]>
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_volunteer=And if I stay here, I'll never make any difference. I just wished I could get the opportunity to forge my own pathin the world without being the supposed weakling of my clan... With ones who would support me rather than tear me down.[face:grim]
