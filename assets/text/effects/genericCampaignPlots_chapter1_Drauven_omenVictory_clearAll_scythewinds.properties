What's a person made for, besides this?/[face:grim]We really can [i]help people,[] if we want. Protect them. I think, proving that, it's going to feel like an obligation./[face:skeptical]I'll just say it... I could learn to enjoy this. Haven't got my blood going like [i]that[] since... I mean, really, since forever./[face:grim]We really can [i]help people,[] if we want. Protect them. I think, proving that, it's going to feel like an obligation./Remember I said it'd be a dark day?

~01~~panel_002~9_loner=<coward.exists:<loner.coward/goofball/romantic/snark/60:You, uh... you're okay? I'm surprisingly okay./[face:interested]This past <season-1>, I was skipping rocks and sending off wishes for an adventure./[face:interested]Yeah. Feels to me.../If you say so./Mm.>/[face:grim]Not much here. Food they've got kind of grosses me out. That they were picking at it.>
~01~~panel_003~4_loner=<coward.exists:<loner.coward/goofball/romantic/snark/60:Not a lot they brought with them./[face:joy]And now I'm studying lizard tracks and pretending I have a clue!/[face:talking]Like the opening of a grand story./Don't see much more than scuffed mud and bad food./Not a lot they left us to find.>/[face:grim]This was all of them, though. Or that's at least what it looks like.>
~01~~panel_003~5_narration=A brief sifting through the Drauven dreck reveals very little.

I mean next time. \nFelt like they could miss one of us and hit the other./[face:neutral]It'll never be as scary as that first time, I'm thinking. I'm hoping./[face:skeptical]So is this... Going to feel normal, soon?/[face:talking]It's one battle under our belt. At least it's a start.>/<romantic.bookish/healer/hothead/leader/romantic/60:[face:skeptical]<loner>, I want to be reasonable--and intentional, right?--about our priorities. Or I mean our course of action? As far as...?/[face:talking]<loner>, I just want to say... we can take our time. Deciding what any of this means./[face:happy]At this point, I think we can be public with a kiss. Right, <loner>?/<loner>? Let's talk about how we can... be public. With our hearts. Is that alright?[face:neutral]/<loner>?[face:talking] I want to say that... Well, stolen kisses are great, and all. But it's even better standing next to you in the sun... and thinking thoughts about forever. I, um.../Uh, <loner>.[face:interested] We, uh, what we [i]almost[] said... There's a few things to talk about.>/I... That's a battle under our belt, right? It's a start.[face:skeptical]>/[face:grim]Stupid way to lose someone like <deadHero.1>.>/>

~01~~panel_005.(coward_exists)~1_coward=<coward.exists:<coward.personality:We've proven we can fight them. Proof compels action, and for us, that should probably mean organizing. Forming a company. Studying. Recruiting./[face:interested]Or, okay, well, do we now start going around and... you know, [i]doing this?[] I'm not saying we should. But what do you guys think?/[face:joke]This's something we could all get good at, right? Tromping around, dueling with lizards? Saving <coward.awm:lovely and lonely spinsters/handsome and lonely bachelors>, and maybe winning a little fame and fortune?/[face:talking]I mean, this's going to become our [i]work[] now, isn't it? Thing is, I want to make sure we don't go unrewarded for it./[face:talking]We're able to fight, it seems like. At least, we're on our way to knowing how. And it'd be hard to just go back to our lives, or slink away right? People need us./[face:angry]We've got a score to settle, don't we? Them tromping in here, toppling towns and brutalizing folks? We've got to take what we did here, and go for their [i]leaders.[]/[face:neutral]We were saying it before. Someone's got to take the fight to [i]them.[] What we showed today is that it's us. We're who has to do it./It's not [face:neutral]trying to save the world or anything. It's just, if [i]I[] want to live how I do... or you, <loner>, or <romantic>... comes down to fighting for it, right?/There were <hero.exists:a few/three> adolescent cubs of a slain mother bear. Together they chased off the hunter who'd felled her. But they didn't stop growing then. In fact, they'd only just begun.[face:talking]/A night can end with a dance and a hallyhoo. Or it can be full of mourners, wailing round a grave. We'll be the ones who dance, or the ones in the ground.[face:grim]/Like, I'm not one who's got illusions of world-saving. But I just think for any of [i]us[] to survive. We've got to keep fighting.[face:interested]>/>

Have to be careful, and conscious of our conditioning. Alright?/Have to travel light. Have to be brave, but also [i]discerning[] when it comes to choosing our fights. Okay?[face:talking]/[face:neutral]Let's not decide ourselves great heroes before we've slain even our own number in foes, okay?/[face:talking]This's what my life was meant to be. Someday, I swear, we'll be known wherever we go. Welcomed, fed, and roofed./[face:neutral]Us <hero.exists:together, I suppose,/three> is fine. I'm willing to try it, long as we're not beholden to anyone./[face:skeptical]To be clear... we're choosing how to die. And I'm with you in the sense... I'd rather take a few with me./One small victory's all this was. Just be aware of your own limits.[face:grim]>/[face:grim]Yeah. Yeah, we kind of have to keep at it, don't we?>/[face:grim]Friends, I'll take the name you wanted for us... and I'll make it great. I promise you.>
