~01~~panel_001~1_hook=As it sweeps through <hook>, the blade of the Ghosthunter proves its legend true.
~01~~panel_002~1_hook=...while a black shadow courses from <hook.mf:his/her/their> body, torn forcefully loose.

~01~~panel_003~4_action=...guh...
~01~~panel_003~5_hook2=<hook>...?
~01~~panel_003~6_narration=Without even a whisper, the shadow dissipates.
~01~~panel_004~2_hook=<hook2>.
~01~~panel_005~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]I'm going to assume that's a look of annoyed recognition and not, like... ghost-fury./[face:interested]It's you, isn't it? You're back?/<hook2.healer/loner/snark:Tell me you're you. Tell me you're okay, and that this nightmare can end./It's you, isn't it, <hook>? If it's not, then you'd better just say so right now./[face:skeptical]You're making a ghost expression...>/--->
~01~~panel_006~3_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:skeptical]It was in me, <hook2>. It... but it's gone now. The ghost is gone. At least I think it is. /I never left. There was this other mind in me. And now... it's gone.[face:interested]/<hook2.healer/loner/snark:[face:interested]I... I feel like me. Unclouded. I just wish that I could be sure.../[face:skeptical]Wouldn't the ghost just claim to be me, anyway? I mean, didn't it?/[face:skeptical]Is that my ghost expression, now?>/--->
~01~~panel_007~4_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:dubious]Sounds like you want me to make sure./Is it?[face:skeptical]/<hook2.healer/loner/snark:Would a kiss prove anything...?[face:happy]/[face:dubious]You don't have to be [i]so[]reassuring, love.../[face:angry]That's the face the ghost always made!>/--->
~01~~panel_008~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:scared]/[face:happy]Why, you want to take another swing, do you?/<hook2.healer/loner/snark:[face:joke]Can't wait, can you?/I'm sorry, I just... I remember all of it./[face:grim]bEsT nEWs. I aM bEinG pERfeCtLY nOrmAL noW.>/>
~01~~panel_008~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:[face:joke]/[face:happy]You kind of deserve it./<hook2.healer/loner/snark:[face:joy]Nope!/[face:sad]No, [i]I'm[] sorry. I can't imagine how it must've felt./[face:dubious]That's not how it talked. But I'll sword you again if you want.>/>
~01~~panel_009~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:An awkward quiet takes them over, and steers them out of the room. The dawn outside beckons bright and warm./They climb together towards the dawning sunlight./<hook2.healer/loner/snark:Their kiss is soft, fleeting, almost unreal as the cobwebs that seem to hover in the low light, the newly stirring air. They leave that place, coming up in a too-brilliant dawn./A strange silence engulfs them. Like a wind, it propels them out of this dead place, into the dawn./The morning is outside. Their smiles won't feel so forced when the sun is on their faces.>/--->
~01~~panel_010~2_narration=Later...
~01~~panel_011~2_hook2=Do you really have to?
~01~~panel_012~1_hook=<hook2>. <hook2>, I have to wonder...
~01~~panel_013~1_hook=Did you know the sword would work? I mean. That it wouldn't... Kill me?
~01~~panel_014~1_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:<hook2.bookish/leader/snark/60:I knew. It says it in all the great legends of <npc.fullname>. What can you trust if you can't trust the epics?/I thought about what I would've wanted you to do, in my place. That's what stopped me hesitating./Well. You know. Either way./To leave you in the power of that... whatever [i]that[] was. I wouldn't wish that on my... well, I wouldn't wish it on you.>/<hook2.bookish/healer/poet/60:The legend of <npc.fullname> includes much of the blade <npc.mf:he/she/they> wielded, the Ghostqueller. So... Yes. I knew. Famously, it would cut out the covetous spirit before it cut the flesh itself./I've seen hauntings aplenty, ghosts and the like. The one consistent thing I found was that what hurts a human will not hurt a spirit. And what hurts a spirit will not hurt a human./The sun rises and sets. Moon and stars come out. I knew it would work. [i]How[] I knew...? Something bigger than me is responsible./I knew it would work. I don't know [i]how[] I knew. But please don't believe I risked your life in doubt...>/<hook2.bookish/loner/romantic/60:I did extensive reading, way back when. It was when I  first surmised you'd been, in part, inhabited by a thing not yourself. In fact, it was that one night when.../I was used to being alone, once. Sometimes, I've even felt destined for it. But in that moment, I knew: I'm [i]supposed[] to be with you. So I... I just knew. Sorry. I wish I had better words./I mean, you can't deny the drama of it, can you? The <hook2.whm:sorrowed, brave-eyed <hook2.mf:battle prince/battlequeen/battledancer>/hard-bodied, soft-hearted <hook2.mf:vagabond/huntress/vagabond>/wise and <hook2.mf:rugged mage/beautiful sorceress/comely mystic>>, facing <hook2.mf:his/her/their> love across the distance of a blade? Fighting to save <hook.mf:the man's/the woman's/the person's> spirit from a Lostling's cold clutches...?/I believed it. To say you know something, when you've never seen it proven... feels like a lie.>/--->
~01~~panel_016~1_hook=<hook2>...
~01~~panel_017~1_hook=<hook.rfln.hook2:I suppose I'm lucky to know you. Even if it rarely feels that way./You're an awful liar./<hook2.bookish/loner/romantic/60:I love you./Don't give up hope. You may still end up alone./Tell me more about this <hook2.whm:brave-eyed <hook2.mf:battle prince/battlequeen/battledancer>/hard-bodied <hook2.mf:vagabond/huntress/vagabond>/<hook2.mf:rugged mage/beautiful sorceress/comely mystic>>. \nSounds like someone I should meet./[face:talking]Your courage, then, meant my life.\nThat's the memory I'll hold.>/--->
