.blurb=<hook> and <hook2> have arrived at <site>.
.longName=In Softer Light
.name=Event
~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hook2=Ho! <hook.rfln.hook2:Dimmed one. See that line?/<hook>, look there!/<hook>, do you see that form?/>
~01~prompt~panel_001~2_narration=Their quest to inter the ashes of a friend and elder goes mostly unhindered... until they reach the woods.
~01~prompt~panel_002~1_hook=The river curls blue like a coil of hair down the coal-colored cheek of the mountain. Ancient pilgrims wander its winding course, the trees.
~01~prompt~panel_003~1_hook2=<hook.personality:You quoting something?/<hook>? You okay?/Um. Yeah./Are you feeling alright?/Uh-huh. You sound like you're coming home./You really do seem different, these days./Alright, then./You really like it out here?/Whoa. Was that spontaneous?/You're not about to start singing, are you?/That's kind of poetic for you, isn't it?>
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_hook=I'm just remembering how old <legend> used to tell it. Those are <legend.mf:his/her/their> words. This looks like the place.
~01~prompt~panel_005~2_narration=They descend into woods that grow more thickly than expected. A symphony of echoing birdsong greets them, and never ceases.
~01~prompt~panel_006~1_hook2=<legend.mf:His/Her/Their> words or not, it sounds like they stuck with you.
~01~prompt~panel_006~2_hook=Mm, sure. The thing is...
~01~prompt~panel_007~2_hook=<hook.personality:I've studied plenty in my life. But the lessons I never intended to learn have hit me hardest. Loss. Grief. Shame./I've learned to walk beside my fear. Not because I like to, but because I know it'll be there anyway. But <legend.mf:he/she/they>.../I know you often see me smiling, but... I've had moments I had to face the darkness. Monsters. Death. Pain./There's a reason I tend to be jealous with my things. I've lost a lot, you know? But <legend.mf:he/she/they>.../Time goes by. I've always cared a lot, you see? And been worn down by it. Watched people wither. Seen places burn. Good tools rust./I was born with fire in me. It's served me well. Helped me live through some things. But [i]living through[] means you're carrying something on. A lot of darkness. Death./I always had the tendency to take on all I could. Responsibility for people, for places. Leaves you with some pride, but also a lot of regrets. But <legend.mf:he/she/they>.../I never had much use for people. Didn't like how easily one neighbor gets turned against the other. At one point, I stopped trusting [i]anyone[], but <legend.mf:he/she/they>.../I tend to look into myself a lot. And to look for the truth in things. And what I've seen... sometimes it weighs on me. The weight of a beast, its gouging talons./I've often imagined a grand adventure. Full of beautiful faces and enchanting views. But every experience I've had took some of that out of me until.../I always felt like people were unrealistic about stuff. Love, and dreams, and all the things they sing about. To me, that was just... out of reach. But <legend.mf:he/she/they>...>
~01~prompt~panel_007~3_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:/[face:interested]/[face:sad]/--->
~01~prompt~panel_008~1_hook=<legend.fullname> was so much older. And yet the [i]hope[] and [i]human fondness[] in <legend.mf:his/her/their> eyes... I think it kept me from sinking.
~01~prompt~panel_009~1_hook2=Hold up, <hook>. There's Drauven.
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_hook=They've been stalking us for some time.
~01~prompt~panel_011~2_hook=It's not many of them, from what I can tell.
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~1_hook2=If it's Drauven, they'll hit us when we're [i]not[] ready. <hook2.hothead.60:Let's paste them to the trunks./Let's get this over with.>
~02~choice_yes~panel_001~2_narration=Provoke a fight.
~03~choice_no~panel_001~1_hook=We're here to bury <legend>. <hook.leader/healer/poet/60:Anyway, there's not enough of them. They won't risk it./Who knows? Maybe they're on a similar errand?/More honor to pass in peace, if we can./I think let's avoid them, if possible.>
~03~choice_no~panel_001~2_narration=Ignore the Drauven.
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_001~2_hook2=<hook.rfln.hook2:Don't worry about me./And thorough. No spears left at our backs, right?/Let's just look out for each other./--->
~04~player_chose_yes~panel_002~1_hook=Let's make it quick, then.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_001~1_hook=Hello? Drauv? Are you there?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_003~1_hook=We wish only to honor our dead. Please let us pass. We'll bury <legend.mf:his/her/their> ashes by the river, and we'll go.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_004~1_hook=Drauv? If you don't answer me, I'll assume you're letting us pass!
~05~player_chose_no~panel_004~2_hook2=<hook>...
~05~player_chose_no~panel_005~2_hook2=You really think they can understand you?
~05~player_chose_no~panel_006~2_hook=Why not? If I was a Drauv, knowing humanspeak would be a useful skill.
~05~player_chose_no~panel_007~1_hook=Luckily, or by some deeper influence, <hook> and <hook2> made it to the river without incident...
