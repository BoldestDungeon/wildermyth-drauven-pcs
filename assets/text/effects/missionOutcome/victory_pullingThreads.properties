~01~prompt~panel_001~1_hero3=After the last creature falls, what is left of the tapestry drops and whips apart with a crackle. One more figure is expelled from it before the threads curl and burn away.
~01~prompt~panel_004~1_legend=You’re human. Or close enough. But are you [i]real[] this time?
~01~prompt~panel_005.(deadHero_exists)~1_mystic=<mystic.hothead/loner/80:[face:angry]/[face:grim]/[face:sad]>Real enough to die. How real is that?
~01~prompt~panel_006.(deadHero_exists)~1_narration=The silence settles and seeps into the folds of the room.
~01~prompt~panel_007.(deadHero_is_missing)~1_mystic=<mystic.poet/bookish/hothead/goofball/snark/greedy/80:Assuming we're not all some mountain god's dream, yes. We're real./That’s quite the philosophical discussion. But short answer, we think so./[face:grim]We’re as real as it gets./[face:joke]Friend, we’re as real as it gets./[face:dubious]We’re as real as it gets./[face:joke]Friend, we’re as real as it gets./As real as anything else in the Yondering.>
~01~prompt~panel_008.(deadHero_is_missing)~1_legend=Hrm. That’s what they said the other times.
~01~prompt~panel_009.(deadHero_is_missing)~1_mystic=Hm. <mystic.bookish/poet/romantic/80:Give us a chance, and I think you’ll find that we persist… sufficiently./Give us a chance, and I think you’ll find that we persist quite well./Give us a chance, and I think you’ll find that we persist quite well./Well, stick around for a while and see if we hold up.>
~01~prompt~panel_010~1_mystic=...What do you remember?
~01~prompt~panel_010~2_legend=A name—<legend.fullname>. Enough of a childhood. Long-ended adventures. But not much of what you’re actually asking about. It’s hard to tease apart what happened and what didn’t.
~01~prompt~panel_011~1_legend=<legend.snark/goofball/80:Two things, tops. It’s been a long time, and I was fighting… something./Two things, tops. It’s been a long time, and I was fighting… something./A sense of time passed, and a sense of purpose. Fighting… something.>
~01~prompt~panel_012~1_mystic=Then perhaps not so much has changed. We’re fighting too, it turns out.
~01~prompt~panel_013~1_mystic=If you want to pick up where you left off.
~01~prompt~panel_013~2_mystic=You look like someone who can watch a back in a battle.
~02~choice_one~panel_001~1_legend=No... Thanks, but this isn't where I need to be right now.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~1_legend=If you want another fighter, you'll have me.
~03~choice_two~panel_001~2_narration=Cost: <int:legend.legacyTier+1+RECRUIT_COST_ADJUSTMENT> LP
~04~player_chose_one~panel_001~1_legend=I’m barely an outline of a person at this point. I’ve got things to figure out. But good luck with the… who did you say you were?
~04~player_chose_one~panel_002~1_mystic=<company>.
~04~player_chose_one~panel_003~1_legend=Right. A company. <legend.loner/snark/goofball/hothead/80:Well, whatever keeps you on the same page./Well, whatever keeps you on the same page./Well, whatever keeps you on the same page./Well, whatever keeps you on the same page./It’s good to have a name like that. Reminds you of what you’re in together.>
~04~player_chose_one~panel_004~1_narration=The party moves on after the rain clears, leaving <legend> with some food and an unknown path ahead.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_001~1_legend=<legend.coward/loner/greedy/snark/goofball/80:[face:interested]I’d rather get as far from this place as I can, anyway./[face:interested]I’d rather get as far from this place as I can, anyway./[face:joke]You seem like a worthy cause to attach my name to./[face:skeptical]What else am I going to do, sit around on all these rugs?/[face:joy] Wind me up and point me in a direction!/A cause to lend my <legend.weaponType> to would be for the best.>
~05~player_chose_two~panel_002~1_mystic=We’ll fill you in on the state of the land. It’s not in the best shape at the moment, but that’s why we’re out here.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_003~1_legend=And good thing you were, I suppose.
~05~player_chose_two~panel_004~1_narration=After the rain cleared, <company> trekked on, one thread stronger in their own woven story.
