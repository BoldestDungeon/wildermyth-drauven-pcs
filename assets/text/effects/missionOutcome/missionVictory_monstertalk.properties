~01~~panel_001~2_goofball=Someone doing dragon pictures?
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=The <threat.cdgmt:Deepists are all dead/Drauven are routed/Gorgonoids are slain/Morthagi are mashed apart/Thrixl are slain>. Battle's led them down a boulderous roam where gray grass matches the cloud color.
~01~~panel_003~2_goofball=Hey, <loner>. Old <loner.fullname>, the <loner.theme_tree/theme_wolf/theme_crow/theme_fire/theme_shadow/theme_star/theme_skeleton:treeish <loner.mf:man/lady/one>. You're good to ask./president of Wolfland. You're doing good, <loner>./crow <loner.mf:king/queen/master>. Perfect./flame <loner.mf:boy/lady/thrower>. Perfect./shadow <loner.mf:man/lady/weaver>. Perfect./astral <loner.mf:man/lady/one>. Good./skeleton one. Hi, skeleton./<loner.whm:fighter we deserve./trailwalker./magic <loner.mf:man/lady/one>.> You badly hurt?>
~01~~panel_003~3_loner=Hm?
~01~~panel_004~2_goofball=So what's your favorite monster?
~01~~panel_004~3_loner=Oh. <loner.coward/hothead/loner/60:Uh, probably/Definitely/Why? I guess.../I'd say> <loner.personality:Dnontha.[face:happy] The celestial worm that eats stories, and [i]produces[] stars./something small and funny, like a pieclops./[face:happy]Dinnerwolf. Cute idea, him stealing the ham. Walking on two legs./the Mulkmorrow Creature. Up all night crafting quartz out of moonbeams./Doctor <npc>. Noble, but tragically fallen. <npc.mf:His/Her/Their> story moves me./the Tenfold Gorilla. Busting big lizards. Always was partial to that./the Rain Bear. Ambles in and out of every myth, it seems./[face:neutral]none of them. Well, the Banyanman, I always understood./[face:happy]Maud's moth. Like the idea of a giant moth, drawn to listen to great poetry./the <loner.awm:Lynxlady, Charvanya./Foxman, Dvan.> Because, well... [face:interested]Like to imagine <loner.awm:her/him>. Us. Meeting. /the Mudwallower. Some shark-pig, living in the swamp? Appeals to me.>
~01~~panel_005~4_romantic=Got to be a classic. Like... <romantic.personality:an ancient vampire. Raised in a castle from a bygone age, intelligent and charming beyond all question./Mine would be a Goblin. Something I could easily disbelieve./A skeleton! Got that amiable expression all the time!<goofball.theme_skeleton: No offense intended./><loner.theme_skeleton: Not you, though, <loner>. Obviously./>/A troll! I'd make a deal with him, and we'd run a bridge-building business to span all rivers![face:joy]/The Phoenix. I like the symbolism, mostly: finding rebirth in the literal ashes of ruin./[face:scheming]The Kraken! Eight-hundred arms and a wise-eyed face! Strength to move the continents!/The hydra. Think about it. Everything it does, it does with the input of six or seven heads? Must be good at compromise./Do we count dryads? I came here to say dryads. Don't ask me specifically why./The Giant. A race of monstrous folk, different from us, and yet not entirely. The essence of monstrosity lies in the twisting of a human ideal./A unicorn, <romantic.awm:with a beautiful, dark-haired woman on its back. Eyes mystical and deep. She sings in a forest tongue./tended by a tall handsome man with broad shoulders and a smoldering stare. He does the feed, and all. Carries water.>/I don't know, a werewolf. That's a... I mean. I don't [i]care[], but a werewolf [i]is[] kind of sexy.>
~01~~panel_006~5_goofball=Those answers are fine. But...\nSome of us will always love a dragon.
~01~~panel_007~5_goofball=<goofball.personality:Dragons embody the essence of the Monster, that thing beyond human capacity: not just fierce, but impossibly cunning, wise, heartful. Distinctly [i]above[] the human apex./The dragon is a symbol of terror, isn't it? And yet, there's a kind of... sympathy? I don't know. Almost, right? I guess I wish I [i]was[] a dragon./<goofball.personality2:Dragons come in every geometry, every chromatic flavor, can be evil or good in their hearts. A legendary monster tailored to the tale they'll serve...[face:happy]/[face:joy]Not that I find dragons unthreatening, but more that I find them... admirable. Worth seeing, even if it's the last thing you take in./==/[face:happy]I've always identified with the way dragons... I don't know, they've got all this power, accrue all this wealth... but they're always worried they'll lose it. Even a [i]fraction[] of it. It's [i]funny[]./[face:happy]I don't know. Part of me, my heart goes out to beings like the dragons. Lonely in their majesty. [i]I'd[] be friends with a dragon. Make her laugh sparks!/[face:interested]Relate to them, sort of. I fly on an air of fun and farce, but I know, too, about the limits of rage. How far that can take you. I'd make a pretty awesome dragon, I feel like./[face:happy]If I was a dragon, I'd be on your side, you know? That's what I feel like, I feel like a dragon [i]chooses sides[]. Not every monster does./A dragon. It's a funny creature to identify with. I see myself as a dragon. A mist dragon. All my ferocity an illusion./[face:joy]You laugh, maybe. But that was the one thing I never felt the spirit to mock. A dragon. All myths arise from somewhere. Some distant truth./[face:happy]A dragon! Such a romantic figure, really, that it surprises me neither of you said it. I'll [i]always[] look at clouds and shape dragons from them. Theeglind, and Do-Essi. Mighty Kthaun of Netherflare./[face:joy]I know, it's the most typical monster of all, probably. I can't help it! Think about finding a clutch of dragon eggs, hidden somewhere. Raising one to be my sarcastic and humorously voracious companion.>/Any hoard-keeping beast is dragonly, to my mind. Appreciate how a dragon makes <goofball.mf:his/her/their> bed, and how direct the metaphor is. Being comforted by wealth./Elicits sympathy, doesn't it? A dragon. The right kind of dragon, I suppose. Always figured, if it came to it, that I'd befriend a dragon. They sound like lonely beings./[face:joy]There'll never be something as monumentally awesome as a firebreathing dragon. I could definitely see myself riding one. It'd be black. Or maybe red./Just the legends, you know? The impossible challenge they represent. And the way we both fear them, and feel sympathy for them. Hm. Was always drawn to dragons./When did I start to love dragons? I don't know. Sometimes, they're the only things in this world -- I realize they're imaginary -- but they're the only beings I feel that I understand./Dragons glide on that line between the imaginary and the real. To me, it's the great example of how a thing becomes so fully realized through thought that it [i]is[] real, in all but the final and most mundane details. Hm./[face:happy]A dragon! Such a romantic figure, really, that it surprises me neither of you said it. I'll [i]always[] look at clouds and shape dragons from them. Theeglind, and Xamantha. Mighty Glyffrix of Netherflare./And sure, a dragon's a broad, overdone idea. But of all the monsters, it captures my heart, somehow. From when I was young. I'd love to find proof. Maybe I'll get one painted on my door.>
~01~~panel_008~6_loner=Can't wait until we're around a fire.
~01~~panel_008~7_goofball=[face:happy]The stories will soar.
