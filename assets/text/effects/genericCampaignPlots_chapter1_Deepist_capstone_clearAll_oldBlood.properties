~01~~panel_002~3_hero3=<hero3.personality:[face:neutral]Can take pride, at least, in our ability to decipher slopscratch. I'll tell you, I don't even find it fascinating to look at, anymore. Just want it to be over./[face:grim]Pretty... pretty weird. That featureless vaunted bull. Doesn't [i]scare[] me anymore, as much as... I'm starting to really hate it./[face:happy]Someone couldn't resist adding their hornhead, huh? I bet everyone secretly [i]hates[] that <hero3.mf:guy/girl/guy>./[face:skeptical]Not how you'd adorn your grand entrance, I wouldn't think. If you were confident? Pretty skulky, really./[face:sad]So it [i]is[] out here. I wonder how many... No, I guess I can't worry about them now. Let's try and make sure no one else is ever tempted to come to such a desperate place./[face:grim]There's the mucky little hiding hole. I'm not in favor of waiting, if you're about to suggest it./[face:talking]At least... we can put aside the weight of [i]finding[] it. Are we ready for what we'll find?/[face:neutral]It's really out here./[face:neutral]You can practically sense beneath you... all the lostward feet that have wandered here. Frailly hoping./[face:interested]I sometimes forget, I think. How there's people that feel isolated and hopeless enough... to search out a lonely, evil-belching place like this./[face:dubious]I wonder how we'll know the place.[hero2.face:dubious]>
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=They've followed the spare, sketchy map on the underside of the statue.
~01~~panel_003~2_narration=Landmark by landmark, with plenty happening between home and here.

~01~~panel_004~6_action=[gray][actionSmall]clatter...
~01~~panel_005~1_hero2=<hero.rfln.hero2:<hero2.bookish/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:Unreasonable to expect we can just sneak in on them through the front door. I'm telling you, we have to formulate a more... []surreptitious[] approach./If we were hoping to leap in before they stuff all their treasures away... I think your stomping through the front door's dashed [i]that[] plan./I should be going first, not [i]you.[]/[face:neutral]You're loud. And off-balance./[face:dubious]Following [i]you[] into a den of Deepists... I'm really asking for it, aren't I?/Don't get caught too far ahead again.[face:skeptical]>/<hero>? <hero2.coward/goofball/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]Don't suppose they'll come in from behind us, right?/[face:interested]I'm not supposed to be dropping, like, beads at every turn, am I? Unspooling a thread? Because.../What do you think we find in here? Stone idols, bad leather, and bullstuff. But besides all that./I'm not going to hesitate. Don't [i]you[] hesitate, either. If there's [i]people[] left... We'll be able to tell the difference./[face:neutral]Maybe it's better I go ahead? I'm not as well liked./[face:talking]Maybe it's better I go ahead? I'm not as well liked, you know?/Don't get too far ahead. Place could have twists and tunnels we don't see.>/<hero2.bookish/coward/goofball/loner/romantic/snark/60:[face:interested]Know how I was reading you <npc3.lastname>'s passage on the self-reinforcing nature of religious groups and beliefs? I, uh... don't want you to think about that. Think about me, and survive, okay?/[face:interested]<hero>, we can turn around, still. We can just... go and.../[face:happy]Hey, <hero>? If either of us die here, I won't get to show you Squatting Rock. Something to think about. You'll definitely want to see it./[face:neutral]Others'll be upset if you don't make it. I... will also be upset./[face:grim]It's simple, thinking about it, you know? I'd rather be here with you, facing violence and death... than relaxing the year away in a garden... with anyone else./[face:skeptical]Hey, <hero>? Remember, I'll move on quick if you leave me here, today. So... don't think I won't./<hero>? Fight with all you've got, but just... don't get caught out. No one wants to lose you. Me most of all.[face:grim]>/<hero2.coward/hothead/leader/loner/60:This's... I just worry this's... that it's.../I can take the lead, you know?[face:grim] I [i]want[] to./[face:neutral]We're right behind you. Go a little slower./[face:neutral]Might be a mistake./Hey, uh... <hero>? After we get through this... let's get to know each other.[face:interested]>>
~01~~panel_006~2_hero=[gray]<hero.rfln.hero2:<hero.coward/goofball/leader/loner/poet/60:[face:interested]You're being too noisy. Please![hero2.face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]I keep thinking I'm hearing a goose honk. Is that [i]you?[][hero2.face:dubious]/<hero2>. Need you to have my back, for this. We can talk later.[hero2.face:grim][hero.face:neutral]/This isn't the time for your chatter. Quiet or go back.[face:neutral][hero2.face:grim]/[face:talking]The unsteadiest wheel is the loudest.[hero2.face:skeptical]/Quit whining at me. You're [i]echoing.[][face:grim][hero2.face:skeptical]>/<hero2.coward/goofball/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:neutral]Don't know if we've taken any measures to prevent it.../[face:neutral]<hero2>. Just make sure you don't stumble.[hero2.face:skeptical]/[face:grim]Bones.[hero2.face:neutral]/[face:neutral][hero2.face:skeptical]We'll keep an eye on each other, <hero2>./[face:neutral][hero2.face:neutral]Idiot. Come on./[face:dubious][hero2.face:happy]Do you [i]really[] want to? Or are you just...? Right. Please focus./[face:grim][hero2.face:grim]It almost certainly does.>/<hero2.bookish/coward/goofball/loner/romantic/snark/60:[face:happy]Okay./[face:neutral]I love you. Come on./[hero2.face:happy][face:skeptical]That's what you're telling me? In this death-shadowed moment?/[face:happy][hero2.face:grim]How sweet, <hero2>. And I'll say... Your death would make me pretty annoyed./[face:skeptical]Even that [i]"freckled and fine-figured"[] hill poet? The <hero2.awm:girl/boy> in your journals?[hero2.face:interested]/[face:neutral]And I'll move on anyway, just as soon as we're done with this. Got it?[hero2.face:joy]/[face:neutral][hero2.face:neutral]Whatever happens... whatever happens, we'll have this year.>/<hero2.coward/hothead/leader/loner/60:[face:neutral][hero2.face:skeptical]It's what we do, <hero2>. It's just what we do./[face:neutral]Which is why [i]I'm[] going first.[hero2.face:skeptical]/[face:neutral][hero2.face:neutral]Yeah. You're right. And a little [i]quieter.[]/[face:neutral]Huh?[hero2.face:skeptical] [i]What[] might be?/<hero.loner.60:[face:neutral]Hm. Maybe./[face:talking]Sure. Good plan.>[hero2.face:interested]>>
~01~~panel_007~3_narration=Soft light and low noise comes round the corner.
~01~~panel_008~3_narration=Milling in the near dark, Deepists mutter and stamp. Rotten hide and human refuse reek on the air.
~01~~panel_008~4_hero=<hero.deepistStart_apprentice:<npc.mf:Master/Lady/Master> <npc.lastname>... <hero.personality:all your accounts never fully conveyed to me... the [b]stench.[] And the beat of my fear./[face:interested]Could really use your words, right now.../[face:interested]Really wish you could smell this./[face:neutral]Guess now we find out if our time and training was really worthwhile./[face:neutral]This won't heal anything. But I hope you'll have some peace in your remaining years./[face:angry]This's for your <npc2.mf:brother/sister/sibling>. And for you./This's for you. All your lessons lead me here, and your suffering sturdies my arm./I was the right choice. And... I know that, now./No metal untested is worth trusting, as you say. Here's how I learn to trust myself./Wish you could see your pupil now[face:neutral].../You old turkey. This's what you sent me to do, and it's really... really wretched.>/>
