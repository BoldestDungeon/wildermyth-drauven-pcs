I hope./[face:interested]Refusing to die is fine, it's the... well, shouldn't that mean you run [i]away[] from the danger? Instead of straight [b]at[] it?/[face:happy]Think about the kids who dared you to eat that beetle. Zick and Terran and Mootfoot.

~01~prompt~panel_013~2_loner=<loner.personality:[face:interested]This's a fascinating moment, <romantic>. Studying this Drauv. There's two of them. One's gone off.

Can't help wondering which of us are the wolves, and which are the hares./That's a Drauv. Been watching him and his friend for a while. This's how our myth begins, <romantic>./[face:interested]Big sucker, isn't he? The other one, his bride or his buddy, I'm not sure which... went off into the trees just a bit ago.>
