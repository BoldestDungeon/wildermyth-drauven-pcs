It's atypical.> According to what texts I've managed to get through. Is that what this is?/[face:interested]How long's that fire been going? Are you able to see their numbers? Are they on the move?/Seems like our festive <foes.singular> friends couldn't wait to start the feastfire. Did we bring enough wine?[face:talking]/[face:grim]Hey, this's old land. Families living out here are proud, productive. If we wanted, ever, to get some reward for our efforts. These'd be the folks./[face:interested]What's happened? Thought we had another day, at least, before a fight. Before.../[face:grim]What've they done, though? Those <foes.plural> or whatever? This's [i]their[] fire?/[face:grim]Appears we misjudged how much time we might have. That's what I'm seeing? The <foes.plural> are [i]burning[] this land?/[face:neutral]And now I'm up here... what losing battle am I expected to win?/[face:grim]And it seems we arrive to a fanfare of flames, a billowing flag of smoke. This's why no one should want heroes, or wish to be them. The title comes only to those whose lives are filled with horror./[face:grim]You know, these lands are old. Storied. The families here loved <overlandTile> before that was even its name. Can we save them?/[face:interested]Seems like a real banquet of horrors here, huh? Hope we have more of a plan than just... well, but I guess I know better than to hope.>

~01~~panel_002~1_narration=The inferno below them reaches full bloom.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=The day had begun peacefully enough. From the mountaintop, they can see it won't end without a fight.
~01~~panel_003~2_hero2=Maybe make for that crumbling building. \nIt can hide our descent.
