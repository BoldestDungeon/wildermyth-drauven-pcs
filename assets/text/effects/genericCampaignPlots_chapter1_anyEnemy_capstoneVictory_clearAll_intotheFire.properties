~01~~panel_005~1_npc=<hero3.exists:<hero3.fullname> led us here. Seems we have a lot to thank you for. Not lost on us, though certainly we've lost a lot. Anyway. Better to be alive and landless./[face:grim]You're one of those heroes from afar, aren't you? Seems we have a lot to thank you for. Not lost on us, though certainly we've lost a lot.

~01~~panel_006~1_hero3=<hero3.exists:<hero3.bookish/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:neutral]I once read the <threat.cdgmt:whole Deepism thing began as a kind of... an effort to make a home under the earth, for those who'd lost their love of sun and society. And that distrustful mobs were wont to burn them and smoke them from their warrens. Cut them down./Drauven used to stay far away from us. That they were content to let us be, but that humans went to [i]their[] lands. To make slaves. To burn./Gorgons used to come ashore without any malice, without that special enmity we've felt the brunt of. And that it was the taste of human fire that turned them so fiercely against us./Morthagi were never meant for war. That the battles they came to fight all escalated from professional slights, and the troubled relationships between their masters. Their world burned down. Buried them in black beams./Thrixl don't belong to our world at all. That they came through from another place, a world of wonders, joined to us by the seam in our sky. Makes me wonder, what threatens them there. I wonder if their home has been burned before.> /[face:talking]"Gratitude's what wise people trade in. Something even the destitute can give." That's from <legend.fullname>'s book. Starting to see the truth of it. Fight fire with fire, ill will with good./[face:happy]Does you proud, at least. That's why you fight, so the meek ones can keep going with their lives. Or I guess that's it, I don't know. Sometimes, it's just nice to give as good as you get./[face:neutral]Ever cross your mind? That for all folks suffer at the hands of <threat.plural>, maybe <threat.plural> have suffered the same. Who knows? Maybe it was humans that started it. Long ago.../[face:talking]Told <npc.mf:him/her/them> not to tell you thanks, but I guess you can't fight gratitude. Except with more gratitude? I don't know. Everyone's in trouble, still. Told <npc.mf:him/her/them> to save <npc.mf:his/her/their> thanks for a day we deserved it. Am I rambling now? Yes. Are you listening? Looks like not really.../Know what I'm starting to wonder? Whether these <threat.plural>... or I mean, just... Maybe [i]their[] homes were burnt to ash. Long ago. It feels like that, maybe. Tonight.[face:neutral]>/>
~01~~panel_006~2_hero2=<hero2.exists:<hero3.exists:/It's kind of like two blazes, pitted one against the other. Us and the <threat.plural>. I feel like... the ground between us will [i]all[] be left blackened. However long this goes on. Hopefully, it's done.>/>
~01~~panel_006~3_hero=<hero2.exists:/[face:grim]Wonder if <threat.plural> feel what we feel. Do their homes burn, along with ours? Or were such places... already reduced to cinders? Long ago.>

~01~~panel_007~2_narration=They were wisps of possibility. They had doors to defend, and that made them heroes.
~01~~panel_007~3_narration=Builders will prove more useful, over the next batch of years.
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=But heroes will be needed again.
