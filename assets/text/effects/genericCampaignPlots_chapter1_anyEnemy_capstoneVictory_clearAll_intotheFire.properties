That the battles they came to fight all escalated from professional slights, and the troubled relationships between their masters. Their world burned down.

That's why you fight, so the meek ones can keep going with their lives. Or I guess that's it, I don't know. Sometimes, it's just nice to give as good as you get./<threat.drauven:<hero3.drauven:Have to wonder why they would stop keeping to themselves all of a sudden.

~01~~panel_007~2_narration=They were wisps of possibility. They had doors to defend, and that made them heroes.
~01~~panel_007~3_narration=Builders will prove more useful, over the next batch of years.
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=But heroes will be needed again.
