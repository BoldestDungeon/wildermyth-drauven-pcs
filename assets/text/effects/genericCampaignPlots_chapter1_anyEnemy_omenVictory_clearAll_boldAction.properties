~01~~panel_001~1_narration=Battle ends.

~01~~panel_002~1_narration=The fires don't swallow the town. They're fought down to cinders, and buried.
~01~~panel_002~2_narration=The folks of <town> will have a trying time, salvaging whole ruined lanes, squeezing people under crowded roofs.
~01~~panel_002~3_narration=They'll manage much better than they expect, though.
~01~~panel_003~1_hero=<hero2.exists:/Well. My friends are dead.[face:grim]>
~01~~panel_003~2_hero2=<hero2.exists:<hero3.exists:<hero3> and I agree. We're not going to let that be it./Think you'll probably agree with me, um.> <hero2.bookish/coward/goofball/greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:Anyway, attempting to defend a whole town, knowing as little as we know? We'll die. But if we [i]pursue[] these <threat.cdgmt:cultists/Drauven/twisted creatures/gearbones/weevils>, we'll have a chance to learn about them. [i]And[] hopefully choose our battles./[face:interested]I'm no one's idea of a hero. I know that. Or I... but I don't think I [i]could[] go back to living normally. Knowing [i]they're[] just... [i]out there?[]/[face:happy]I mean, I'm not anyone's idea of a [i]hero,[] I know. But I maybe want to keep using the skills... that I just sort of noticed I've [i]got.[]/You don't let [face:skeptical]a thief just wander off free, do you? They [i]took[] something. Our security. I want it back./I wouldn't let someone wander off who'd [i]kicked[] my door. These jokers [i]burnt it down.[]/[face:neutral]At least... [i]I'm[] heading out there. I don't want to be stuck fighting like that again. Surprised. Caught in the middle of all that. There's a score to settle, anyway. In [i]my[] mind./[face:skeptical]We can't really just... go back to our lives. It'd be [i]awkward.[] Or I mean it'd be dumb. And who's smart? [i]Us.[]/Right thing now is to keep giving chase. Keep using the skills we're noticing we [i]have.[]>/>

~01~~panel_005~1_narration=The <threat.plural> that attacked their homes had mostly moved on by the time any defense was roused.
~01~~panel_005~2_narration=It means they can easily return. Them or others. Perhaps more, and fiercer, and with a [i]deadlier[] will.
