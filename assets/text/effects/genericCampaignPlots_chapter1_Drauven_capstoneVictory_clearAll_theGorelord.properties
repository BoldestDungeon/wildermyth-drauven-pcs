I didn't see./<hunter.personality:[face:skeptical]One of those choices sounds easier on my feet./[face:happy]And you stood up to them. You did good, <hunter>./[face:interested]We're not who we were when we started out, are we?/Tracking them into unknown lands is a little bit more than I want for this day./There's killers whose despair is to watch their victims survive. Remember that, too./[face:interested][i]I'd[] run if the wood-rabbits started picking up swords./[face:neutral]That's pretty philosophical of you. Here, pass me your wine./[face:happy]Your scorn for them doesn't get old, <hunter>. It really doesn't./[face:neutral]There're seasons in this world that take years to pass. And the blood of heroes./[face:dubious]I'm sure you'll look very dashing up there. I'm going to sit down./[face:talking]Thought they [i]all[] had an appointment with my <warrior.weaponType:sword/axe/crusher/spear/bow/crossbow/knife/staff's end/wand's tip/arms>.

I love you./<hunter>,[face:sad] I'm sorry, I just keep... thinking about if you... I mean if they.../[face:interested]Is it too soon to say... how [i]amazing[] you were?/[face:skeptical]How long do I have to wait for a kiss, <hunter>? Do you even [i]care[] that I survived?/[face:interested]Come here and let me look at you, love. That's not all Drauv-blood./They'll never look back our way without a tremble, love.[face:angry]/[face:neutral]I won the love of a <hunter.whm:great warrior./mighty hunter./myth-shaping <hunter.mf:man/woman/mystic>.> I'm proud, today./I'm ready to be away from here. \nAren't you? <hunter>?/Come on, love. We've won back this land... but it belongs to the dead. /[face:happy]<hunter>? Can I say? I just feel like... I'm so [i]lucky[] to be standing by you today./[face:neutral]You're brave, <hunter>. It's as \nannoying as it is magnetic.>/We're a little worn down. Aren't we?>>/>

~01~~panel_003~2_hunter=<hunter.exists:<hunter.personality:Now we have to discern whether it's smarter to pursue... or to stay here. Fortify. See whether they come back./[face:interested]Could've gone a hundred ways, it feels like. But we're alive. And they're running./[face:interested]The idea that Drauven would run from [i]me...[] Funny turns the world takes./[face:skeptical]We can track them, if you want. But we should take stock of what we've won, first./They do feel the same despair we do, when given cause. I find that... sad. This's [i]all[] sad./[face:angry]Look how they run when their prey \nfights back!/A captain's strength is also <hunter.mf:his/her/their> company's weakness. Should <hunter.mf:he/she/they> fall./Hm. Not strong enough on their own, I guess./It's almost as if they're fading into the sky.

Never too late, either.>/[face:dubious]/<hunter.maimedMustHeal:No, it's not. I'm sorry./I'm okay. [i]You[] made it through. \nThat's all I needed.>/<hunter.snark.60:[face:skeptical]That's what you thought to say?/[face:happy]I'm getting a little tremble, myself.>/[face:happy]/<hunter.loner.60:[face:grim]Yeah.
