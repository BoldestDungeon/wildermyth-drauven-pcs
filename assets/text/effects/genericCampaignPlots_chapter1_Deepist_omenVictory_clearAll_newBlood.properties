~01~~panel_005~1_narration=Several days later, in the mountain dawn...
~01~~panel_006~1_narration=<hero2.exists:/<hero> ponders the task ahead. <hero.deepistStart_apprentice:<hero.mf:His/Her/Their> master had prepared <hero.mf:him/her/them> in many ways... but in others, not at all./Like a sudden inheritance, now, it's fallen on <hero.mf:him/her/them>.>>
~01~~panel_006~2_hero2=<hero2.exists:<hero2.personality:We face[face:talking] several interesting dilemmas. Grappling with all the potential outcomes... at least occupies the thoughts./[face:interested]Thousand ways this turns out bad. Thousand ways for us to... well. Have you thought about that at all?/[face:talking]Waking up this early makes me [i]feel[] like a hero. How about you?/You know, one thing I'm genuinely excited for... Seeing what kinds of jewels, or antiques, or whatever they've got stuffed in those caves./[face:talking]You're still worried about <hero.deepistStart_apprentice:your friend,/leaving <npc.mf:him/her/them>> aren't you? The <npc.mf:old man/old woman/old hillmage>? Understandable. Shows your heart./[face:skeptical]Stop staring at the beans and say something. This morning'll stay cold if we're all quiet./[face:talking]So basically, I'm thinking of a system where we each get input, but when one of us calls for a decision, we [i]make[] one. Right? Vote yes or no, and move on. Think that'll work?/Are those beans warm yet?/[face:talking]I forgot who said it: "No appetite of mine was ever sated by my eyes." Dig in, if you're hungry. <hero3.exists:<hero3>'ll be back soon./So what if it's cold?>/They'll draw this moment, I bet. Someday. Us, standing in the early morning.

How many other folks <npc.mf:has he/has she/have they> sent to save the world?[face:skeptical]/[face:skeptical]You know what I wonder?

~01~~panel_006~3_hero=<hero2.exists:/<hero.deepistStart_apprentice:They ought not to have listened. Those <deadHero.3.exists:fools/two>. I wish... but...[face:grim]/[face:grim]Like a <hero.mf:father's/mother's/parent's> secret debt.>>
~01~~panel_007~1_hero=<hero2.exists:/<hero.deepistStart_apprentice:<npc.mf:Master/Lady/Master> <npc.lastname>... I didn't think it'd have such a grim start.[face:grim]/Tragedies seem to have followed that old <npc.mf:man/woman/person>... and now they've got [i]my[] scent too, huh?>>
~01~~panel_007~2_hero=<hero2.exists:<hero2.personality:<hero.bookish/hothead/loner/60:True enough. There's plenty to mull over, but.../[skeptical]What's so complicated about it?

I try not to, obviously, but it's hard not to wonder when the next blow is coming. Actually,[face:interested]/[face:happy]Yeah, I worry a lot, myself. But all that tells me is that I have things worth worrying [i]about.[] And that's a good thing. For instance.../[face:talking]The only way to avoid every shadow is to climb to the highest tower and never go down. That's not living. But.../[face:neutral]No./[face:talking]I try not to get [i]too[] imaginative about how I'll get jumped and janked apart. Actually,>/<hero.goofball/romantic/snark/60:[face:interested]You know what'll make you [i]my[] hero? If you eat this frog I found. Um. But actually,/Oh, not yet. But I'll [i]be[] a hero one day. I made that promise to myself. I... actually,[face:talking]/[face:talking]If I ever feel like a [i]hero?[] I'll know that's the day I kick it. Actually,/It's working hours.[face:talking] But>/<hero.loner.60:[face:neutral]Why? Me,/Pondering that, are you? Riches and things?[face:skeptical] I don't know.>/<hero.hothead/snark/60:[face:skeptical]Relax on that. I'm not worried. It's just... I mean obviously,/[face:neutral]Less worried about [i]<npc.mf:him/her/them>[] [face:skeptical]than I am about [i]us.[] I mean, but... I guess/I don't know. No, it's not that I'm worried. It's just,[face:interested]>/<hero.bookish/loner/poet/snark/60:[face:talking]The temperature, I'm sure you're aware, has nothing to do with how social any of us decide to be. But I suppose I can oblige you./Some of us prefer the cold, some of us prefer the silence. But fine, I'll tell you./[face:talking]Contemplation [i]does[] warm me up, sometimes. It's like my honeycomb, my thoughts, my wondering. But anyway, sorry./[face:dubious][i]All[] of us [i]aren't.[] Anyway, it's nothing./[face:happy]Sorry. You're right. Only thing is,>/<hero.bookish/coward/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:interested]Hm? Apologies, that sounded very organized and well-expressed./[face:interested]Um... not to be annoying, but what if... not everyone can agree? Or. Sorry, actually,/[face:joy]Long as you all follow my lead, I think it'll work! But/[face:skeptical]That sounds... very... I don't really work like that. And/[face:skeptical]Long as we all [i]agree,[] maybe. I don't know./[face:interested]Sounds like the most agreeable way to start, I guess. Actually...>/<hero.goofball/hothead/60:[face:interested]Want to stick your paw in and see? Actually, I'm not paying much attention./[face:grim][i]You[] cook them, then./Sorry, I'm not watching too close. Probably.>/<hero.greedy/hothead/loner/snark/60:[face:skeptical]Trust me, I'm not the kind to flum and fluster about getting everyone their portion. I'm just... Actually,/[face:skeptical]I'd have my beans if I wanted to have my beans. No, I'm.../What?[face:neutral]/[face:dubious]Did a creepo say that? That sounds like creepo-speak. Anyway, I'm actually.../[face:interested]Hm? Oh, that's a generous gesture. No I'm... Actually,>/<hero.goofball/loner/snark/60:Who's going to do that? I feel sorry for whoever has to render my nose, it's basically impossible. Um. But. What's on your mind?/They won't if no one tells them about it.[face:skeptical] And anyway... what's to tell? We're a long way from accomplishing anything./[face:skeptical]"<hero4.exists:/Two >Doomed Rubes with Beans?" Sounds like a sorry picture to me. That what you think about all the time?/[face:talking]What a thought [i]that[] is. Yeah, I don't know, I'm just...>/<hero.deepistStart_apprentice:<hero.coward/hothead/loner/romantic/60:Why?[face:interested] Did any of it ring false to you? Actually,/[face:skeptical]Hey, listen, if you want to badmouth <npc.mf:him/her/them>, you picked the wrong <hero.mf:guy/girl/person> to confide in. In fact,/You don't understand anything. Whatever. It's fine.[face:grim]/[face:grim]None. <npc.mf:He's/She's/They've> done great things for <town>, did you know [i]that?[] Saw potential in me, and... well here you are, too. And/[face:talking]Heh, well, far as I know, we're the first. You can believe what you want, though, that's fine.>/Heh.

~01~~panel_008~8_npc=My <npc2.mf:brother/sister/sibling>, <npc2>... we used to roam this world together. Adventuring, messing with spirits and all. Called <npc2.mf:him/her/the> Lucky Spark. <npc2.mf:He/She/They> was younger. <npc2.mf:He/She/They> married a good and beautiful <npc3.mf:man/woman/person>. Smiling-eyed <npc3>.
~01~~panel_009~8_npc=But <npc2>'s <npc3.mf:husband... he/wife... she/spouse... they> fell awfully sick. An infected shoulder gash, see?

I... <npc2.mf:His/Her/Their> <npc3.mf:husband/wife/spouse> died in this house, fevered and lonely under my care.
~01~~panel_010~1_npc=That was fifty years ago. Since then... I've watched my strength fade. And now the bull-cult rises from the earth... and I find I can't chase them back into it.

But what would it mean to hold back? I don't know./[face:sad]Sounds like the one person in <npc.mf:his/her/their> life that mattered most to <npc.mf:him/her/them>.

Senselessness [i]was[] the goal./[face:sad]And probably's kept that pain inside for all fifty years since. Remarkably... strong, I think. Patient. Enduring./What a wretched life that is.[face:grim] If it was me, I'd probably've gone charging into the nearest den of Deepists I could find. Not caring if I'd come out again./Or perhaps [i]had to[] discredits <npc.mf:his/her/their> courage. You admire that kind of resolve, even as you question... you question a lot of things, I suppose./[face:grim]<hero3.historyTag_sadkid:I got the way I am for a reason. But...

I don't know./I'll say hearing <npc.mf:his/her/their> story made me think. <npc.mf:His/Her/Their> pain didn't stop <npc.mf:him/her/them> from helping.

I don't know.>/[face:neutral]Doctor <legend.fullname>, a tragic figure <legend.mf:himself/herself/themself>, made the famous observation: "The wounds that heal slowest, and leave the most damage, are those we cause."/[face:grim]What a tragic and noble deed. What a beautifully sad and I'm sure [i]exacting[] thing... to live with./[face:skeptical]Not much you can say about that. But... what if someday, we find out you can reverse that... like, [i]slackening,[] can we call it? Make a Deepist healthy and human again?>/>
