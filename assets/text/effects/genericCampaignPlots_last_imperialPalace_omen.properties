.longName=Emperor
~01~~panel_001~1_narration=An emperor reigns over the Drauven now.
~01~~panel_002~1_narration=The Emperor came from elsewhere. His captains flanked him, his soldiers all bore his scalebrand.
~01~~panel_002~2_narration=Whatever Drauvlords he met, he melted their lands and legends, poured them into his golden pool.
~01~~panel_003~1_narration=Domination. That's the word for what he brought here.
~01~~panel_003~2_narration=A flame might struggle to climb its first matchstick, but when it's grown, \nit will eat anything with voracious ease.
~01~~panel_004~2_hero=<hero.drauven:Just like the tales told by the warsongs of <hero.mystic:some of us/the> Deeven. Long ago, perhaps in millenia past, the emperor went on a crusade across the land. Terrorizing the humans and sparing only the Drauven who would submit completely to his will. And the Yondering no longer became the land of the humans, nor even the Drauven some would say. It became his. It's as if he is returning, straight from this myth.../And that's what the story is. That in another Yondering, he fought a bitter struggle. Against human heroes, against other Drauven. And he eventually won. And now, like a wildfire, he's burned his way here.>
~01~~panel_005~3_hero2=<hero2.drauven:<hero2.coward/healer/leader/poet/romantic/60:It can't be? Not the Emperor of legend... Even the Druvimos should not have such a bloodthirsty leader?[face:interested]/[face:sad]And if he succeeds, all of our work to make good relations with the humans will be for nought. Even if the humans were to recover, I doubt they would ever trust a Drauv again. The war would be unending.../[face:talking]The Drauven Emperor of old... Our most worthy opponent yet. We shall show him just how strong the bonds between humans and Drauven can be./[face:talking]The Drauven Emperor of old. The epitome of carnage and grace... We shall show him just how strong the bonds between humans and Drauven can be./The Drauven Emperor, huh? I hope he's as our legends describe. A majestic character, his bellowing cape soaked in the blood of his enemies. <hero2.attractedToMen:The dangerous yet alluring fire in his eyes, his perfectly chiseled... *ahem*, sorry./Charging across the battlefield and laying waste to his enemies like... Wait, we're supposed to be fighting him?!>[face:interested]/[face:interested]Sounds dire. Never tried reading too much into our old warsongs about him. It's... unsettling to think if he's actually real.>/<hero2.coward/healer/leader/poet/romantic/60:How much empire do you [i]need[] in order to be an emperor? Could it just be mostly a story?[face:interested]/[face:talking]Alright, that's enough of that talk, it'll stiffen our joints. Let's not let him make embers out of [i]us,[] okay?/[face:talking]A Drauven Emperor. It's the kind of thing you feel like you're doomed to face, someday./A Drauven Emperor. It's the kind of thing you feel like you're doomed to face, someday./A Drauven Emperor, huh? I hope he's imposing. A majestic character, swirling that red cape of his. Enough to merit all this fanfare.[face:interested]/Sounds dire. Now I remember why I prefer fishing to heroing.>>
~01~~panel_005~4_hero=He's out there.
~01~~panel_006~5_hero3=Yes, he [i]is[] out there. Putting folks out of their homes, brutalizing whoever stands against him. He's starting to have holdings uncomfortably nearby.
~01~~panel_007~1_narration=<hero3> relates the trailnews <hero3.mf:he's/she's/they've> gathered.
~01~~panel_008~1_narration=<season+1> will bring violence.
~01~~panel_008~2_narration=The emperor has a palace, it's said, secreted in some far reach of the hills and mountains.\nFinding it shouldn't be difficult, but the road will likely be blocked with forts and forces
~01~~panel_008~3_narration=A known Drauven position is situated close enough to be vulnerable. That will be their gateway into the emperor's lands.
