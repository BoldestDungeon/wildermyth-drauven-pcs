# WILDERMYTH - PLAYABLE DRAUVEN

This mod attempts to add the ability to recruit Drauven characters to join your party and forge their own legacy.

**This is a work in progress!** The end goal is to produce a full-fledged unlockable race to go out adventuring in the Yondering lands, but each journey begins with a single step! We will do our best to make sure that the `main` branch is always kept in a working state, but expect things to change rapidly right now.

## USING THIS MOD IN OTHER MODS

If you would like to use features of our mod in your own separate mod:

* Check the `company` for the aspect `drauven_pcs_enabled`. 
* Initialize Drauven characters by adding the aspect `drauven_pc_init` to any characters/NPCs when you create them to turn them into Drauven heroes!

If you have any questions about specific functionality, feel free to either message us through Discord or create a new issue in this repo to request the information you need.
