# WILDERMYTH - PLAYABLE DRAUVEN

This mod attempts to add the ability to recruit Drauven characters to join your party and forge their own legacy.

**This is a work in progress!** The end goal is to produce a full-fledged unlockable race to go out adventuring in the Yondering lands, but each journey begins with a single step! We will do our best to make sure that the `main` branch is always kept in a working state, but expect things to change rapidly right now.
